Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650 CE): Descartes is famous for his statement \"I think, therefore I am\" (Cogito, ergo sum), which emphasizes the role of the mind in existence.\n\nHowever, the most influential philosopher in developing the concept of dualism, which posits that the mind and body are separate entities, is:\n\n1. Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650 CE): In his work \"Meditations on First Philosophy,\" Descartes argued that the mind is a non-physical substance, separate from the body.\n\nThe modern concept of the mind-body dualism was further developed by:\n\n1. John Locke (1632-1704 CE): Locke believed that the mind is a tabula rasa, a blank slate, and that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are shaped by our experiences and environment.\n\n2. David Hume (1711-1776 CE): Hume's empiricism posits that knowledge and understanding come from experience and observation, rather than innate ideas or reason.\n\nThese philosophers, among others, have contributed to the development of the mind-body dualism theory, which remains a topic of debate and discussion in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience.", "gold": "Ren\u00e9 Descartes", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.461666705454769e-232, "rouge-1": 0.017316017316017316, "rouge-L": 0.017316017316017316, "semantic-similarity": 0.41524839401245117}},{"question": "how many goals scored ronaldo in his career", "context": "", "answer": "As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored approximately 819 goals in his career, across various leagues and competitions, including the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, and the Champions League.
