She was the daughter of Demeter, the goddess of agriculture and fertility, and was abducted by Hades, the god of the underworld, and became the queen of the underworld.\n\nAs a result of her abduction, Demeter was grief-stricken and refused to let the earth produce any crops until her daughter was returned. Zeus intervened and sent Hermes, the messenger god, to bring Persephone back to the world above. However, before leaving the underworld, Hades tricked Persephone into eating a few pomegranate seeds, binding her to the underworld and forcing her to spend part of each year with him.\n\nEach year, Persephone would return to the world above, bringing spring growth and fertility with her. This myth is often seen as an explanation for the changing of the seasons, with Persephone's return to the world above marking the beginning of spring.\n\nIn some versions of the myth, Persephone is also referred to as Chloris, the goddess of flowers and spring growth, due to her association with the blooming of flowers and the renewal of life.", "gold": "Persephone ( / p\u0259r\u02c8s\u025bf\u0259ni / ; Greek : \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03c6\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7 ) , also called Kore ( / \u02c8k\u0254\u02d0ri\u02d0 / ; `` the maiden '' )", "metrics": {"bleu": 5.691293710187394e-232, "rouge-1": 0.05, "rouge-L": 0.04000000000000001, "semantic-similarity": 0.45100510120391846}},{"question": "how many season of the man in the high castle", "context": "", "answer": "There are 4 seasons of the TV series \"The Man in the High Castle\".", "gold": "<Table> <Tr> <Th colspan=\"2\"> The Man in the High Castle </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td colspan=\"2\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Genre </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Alternate history </Li> <Li> Drama </Li> <Li> Dystopia </Li> <Li> Thriller </Li> <Li> Science fiction </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Created by </Th> <Td> Frank Spotnitz </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Based on </Th> <Td> The Man in the High Castle by Philip K.

It is considered the most important Jewish text and a fundamental part of Jewish scripture.\n2. **The Talmud**: A vast collection of Jewish oral traditions and discussions, compiled into written form. It is a central text in Jewish law, ethics, and philosophy.\n3. **The Mishnah**: A collection of Jewish oral traditions and discussions, compiled into written form. It is considered the earliest written form of Jewish law and ethics.\n4. **The Zohar**: A mystical text written in Hebrew, attributed to Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. It is considered one of the most important texts in Jewish mysticism and Kabbalah.\n5. **The Targum**: A translation of the Hebrew Bible, written in Aramaic. It is a significant text in Jewish interpretation and translation of the Hebrew Bible.\n\nHowever, if we consider the most widely accepted and influential Jewish text, it would likely be the **Torah**. The Torah is the central text of Judaism, comprising the first five books of the Tanakh, and is considered the foundation of Jewish scripture and tradition.\n\n**Torah** is a fundamental text in Judaism, and its importance extends beyond its role as a religious text. It has had a profound impact on Jewish history, culture, and society, shaping the development of Jewish law, ethics, and philosophy.\n\n**Torah** is also considered a living text, as it has been interpreted and studied by Jewish scholars and rabbis throughout history.

idiomatic expression that originated in the United States. The origin of this phrase is unclear, but there are a few theories:\n\n1. **1920s Prohibition era**: One theory suggests that the phrase \"you owe me a Coke\" comes from the Prohibition era in the United States (1920-1933). During this time, people would often have to \"owe\" the government money by buying liquor. If you were late paying back the debt, you'd be \"owed\" another drink, which is where the phrase \"owe me a Coke\" comes from.\n2. **1930s-1940s Speakeasies**: Another theory suggests that the phrase \"you owe me a Coke\" comes from the speakeasies (secret bars) that were popular during the Prohibition era. In these establishments, patrons would often have to \"owe\" the bartender money for the drinks they ordered. If you were late paying back the debt, you'd be \"owed\" another drink, which is where the phrase \"owe me a Coke\" comes from.\n3. **Post-Prohibition**: Some people believe that the phrase \"you owe me a Coke\" originated in the 1940s and 1950s, after the Prohibition era ended. During this time, people would often have to \"owe\" the government money for the taxes they paid on their drinks. If you were late paying back the debt, you'd be \"owed\" another drink, which is where the phrase \"owe me a Coke\" comes from.\n\nRegardless of its origin, the phrase \"you owe me a Coke\" has become a common expression in American culture, often used to convey that someone has borrowed money or is in debt to someone else.", "gold": "Jinx is a children 's game with varying rules and penalties that occur when two people unintentionally speak the same word or phrase simultaneously", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.230276092730482e-232, "rouge-1": 0.05405405405405406, "rouge-L": 0.04054054054054055, "semantic-similarity": 0.12633274495601654}},{"question": "where does the last name hickey come from", "context": "", "answer": "The surname Hickey is of Irish origin.

front moves into an area, it brings a mass of cold air with it. As this cold air moves forward, it collides with the warmer air that was previously present in the region. This collision causes the cold air to sink, creating an area of low pressure near the ground.\n\nAs the cold air sinks, it cools and condenses, forming clouds. The process of cloud formation is known as orographic lift, and it occurs when the air is forced to rise over a mountain or other obstacle, resulting in the formation of clouds.\n\nIn the case of a cold front, the clouds that form are typically:\n\n1. **Cumulus clouds**: These are puffy, white clouds that can appear alone or in large clusters. They are often seen on warm, sunny days, but can also form when cold air moves into an area.\n2. **Stratus clouds**: These are low-hanging clouds that cover the sky and often produce light to moderate precipitation.\n3. **Nimbus clouds**: These are dark, rain-bearing clouds that can produce heavy precipitation and thunderstorms.\n\nThe cold front can also bring other types of clouds, such as:\n\n* **Altocumulus clouds**: These are mid-level clouds that are composed of water droplets and appear as waves or ripples in the sky.\n* **Altostratus clouds**: These are mid-level clouds that are composed of water droplets and appear as a uniform gray or blue layer in the sky.\n\nOverall, the combination of cold air, moisture, and wind shear can lead to the formation of a wide range of clouds, including cumulus, stratus, and nimbus clouds, as well as other types of clouds.", "gold": "<Table> <Tr> <Th> Weather phenomenon </Th> <Th> Prior to the passing of the front </Th> <Th> While the front is passing </Th> <Th> After the passing of the front </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Temperature </Td> <Td> Warm </Td> <Td> Cooling suddenly </Td> <Td> Steadily cooling </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Atmospheric pressure </Td> <Td> Decreasing steadily </Td> <Td> Lowest , then sudden increase </Td> <Td> Increasing steadily </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Winds </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Southwest to southeast ( northern hemisphere ) </Li> <Li> Northwest to northeast ( southern hemisphere ) </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> Gusty ; shifting </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> North to west , usually northwest ( northern hemisphere ) </Li> <Li> South to west , usually southwest ( southern hemisphere ) </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Precipitation / conditions * </Td> <Td> Light patchy rain can be produced by stratocumulus or stratus in the warm sector .

Television, a fee for the use of the judges and the production of the show.\n\nThe show's format involves the judges, who are typically lawyers or law professors, presiding over a series of mock trials, and then providing their opinions on the cases. The show is often broadcast live, and the judges are paid a fee for their time and expertise.\n\nThe production company, Warner Bros. Television, pays the judges a fee for their time and expertise, as well as for the production costs associated with the show, including the costs of filming, editing, and broadcasting. The amount of the fee is not publicly disclosed.\n\nIt's worth noting that the show is a reality-based program, and the judges are not paid a salary. However, the production company does pay the judges for their time and expertise, and the show is often broadcast live, which generates revenue for the network.\n\nHere is a rough breakdown of the estimated costs associated with the show:\n\n* Production costs: $100,000 to $500,000 per episode\n* Judge fees: $50,000 to $200,000 per episode\n* Marketing and advertising: $100,000 to $500,000 per episode\n* Total estimated cost per episode: $250,000 to $1.2 million\n\nIt's difficult to estimate the total annual cost of the show, as it varies from year to year.

If a vacancy occurs, the Senate can fill it with a new nominee, which can increase the Court's size temporarily.\n2. **Life appointments**: In 1869, the 14th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, which states that Supreme Court justices must be elected by the people, not appointed by the President. This means that the number of justices on the Court is fixed at nine (Article III, Section 1).\n3. **Congressional action**: Congress can pass laws that change the size of the Court.

The MCC is usually implemented within 6-12 months of accreditation.\n*   **Healthcare providers:** The MCC is implemented by healthcare providers, such as hospitals, clinics, and medical centers, after they have obtained accreditation and are recognized by regulatory bodies. The MCC is usually implemented within 1-2 years of accreditation.\n*   **Government agencies:** The MCC is implemented by government agencies, such as ministries of health, education, and defense, after they have gained accreditation and are recognized by regulatory bodies. The MCC is usually implemented within 1-3 years of accreditation.\n\nIt's worth noting that the MCC is not a law, but rather a set of guidelines that institutions must follow to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. The MCC is usually implemented in conjunction with other regulatory requirements, such as accreditation and certification.\n\nIn general, the MCC is implemented in the following order:\n\n1.

The central contention of the book can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Critique of Capitalism:**\n\n1. **Critique of the concept of wealth:** Carnegie argues that the pursuit of wealth is not the primary goal of human life. He advocates for a more altruistic approach, where individuals prioritize the well-being of others over personal gain.\n2. **Critique of the idea of self-interest:** Carnegie rejects the notion that self-interest is the driving force behind human behavior. He believes that individuals should prioritize the common good and work towards the betterment of society.\n3. **Critique of the concept of competition:** Carnegie argues that competition is not the primary driver of innovation and progress. He advocates for a more cooperative and collaborative approach, where individuals work together to achieve common goals.\n\n**Critique of Social Inequality:**\n\n1. **Critique of the social and economic status quo:** Carnegie argues that the current social and economic system is unfair and perpetuates inequality. He advocates for a more equal distribution of wealth and opportunities.\n2. **Critique of the role of wealth in society:** Carnegie argues that wealth is not the ultimate measure of a person's worth or success. He advocates for a more holistic approach, where individuals are valued for their character, skills, and contributions to society.\n3. **Critique of the idea of social Darwinism:** Carnegie rejects the idea that the strong should be rewarded at the expense of the weak. He argues that this approach is morally reprehensible and can lead to social unrest.\n\n**Philosophical and Ethical Themes:**\n\n1. **Utilitarianism:** Carnegie advocates for a utilitarian approach, where the greatest good for the greatest number is the primary goal.\n2. **Altruism:** Carnegie emphasizes the importance of altruism and the need for individuals to prioritize the well-being of others.\n3. **Cooperation and collaboration:** Carnegie advocates for a more cooperative and collaborative approach, where individuals work together to achieve common goals.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn \"The Gospel of Wealth,\" Andrew Carnegie presents a comprehensive critique of capitalism, social inequality, and the role of wealth in society. He argues that a more altruistic and cooperative approach is necessary to achieve true prosperity and happiness. The book is considered a classic of modern thought and continues to be relevant today.", "gold": "<P> `` Wealth '' , more commonly known as `` The Gospel of Wealth '' , is an article written by Andrew Carnegie in June of 1889 that describes the responsibility of philanthropy by the new upper class of self - made rich . Carnegie proposed to his wife using the best way of dealing with the new phenomenon of wealth inequality was for the wealthy to redistribute their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner . This approach was contrasted with traditional bequest ( patrimony ) , where wealth is handed down to heirs , and other forms of bequest e.g. where wealth is willed to the state for public purposes . Carnegie argued that poor people put to best use ( i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society ) when it is administered carefully by the poor . Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance , irresponsible spending , or self - indulgence , instead promoting the administration of said capital over the course of one 's lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor . As a result , the wealthy should administer their riches responsibly and not in a way that encourages `` the slothful , the drunken , the unworthy '' . </P>", "metrics": {"bleu": 6.463354487439459e-232, "rouge-1": 0.3141891891891892, "rouge-L": 0.17567567567567569, "semantic-similarity": 0.7854524850845337}},{"question": "when did now thats what i call music come out", "context": "", "answer": "\"Now That's What I Call Music\" is a series of compilation albums produced by Sony Music.

According to the band's lead vocalist Dan Smith, the name was chosen because it symbolizes freedom and rebellion. The band members were inspired by the idea of the Bastille as a symbol of the French Revolution, and they wanted a name that reflected their own values of freedom, rebellion, and nonconformity.\n\nIn an interview with The Guardian, Smith explained:\n\n\"We wanted a name that was a bit more abstract, a bit more poetic. We wanted something that was going to stand out, something that was going to make people think. And the Bastille was a great example of that. It's a place that's associated with revolution, with rebellion, with freedom. And we thought, 'That's a great place to start.'\"\n\nSmith also mentioned that the name was inspired by the idea of breaking free from conventions and expectations. He said:\n\n\"We were all very young, very idealistic, and we wanted to create something that was going to stand out. And the Bastille was a place that was associated with something very different, something that was very different from what we were used to. It was a place that was associated with revolution, with rebellion, with freedom. And we thought, 'That's what we want to be about.'\"\n\nOverall, the band's name reflects their values of freedom, rebellion, and nonconformity, and it serves as a powerful symbol of their music and

on an electrocardiogram (ECG) represents the depolarization of the atria, which is the electrical activity that occurs when the atria contract and pump blood into the ventricles. Specifically, it is the initial phase of the ventricular depolarization, also known as the QRS complex.\n\nIn more detail, the P-wave is the electrical signal that represents the depolarization of the atria, which is caused by the influx of positively charged ions (such as potassium and calcium) into the atrial muscle cells. This influx of ions triggers a series of electrical impulses that propagate through the atria, ultimately leading to the contraction of the atria and the opening of the atrioventricular (AV) valves.\n\nThe P-wave is typically the first component of the ECG tracing, and it is usually followed by the QRS complex, which represents the depolarization of the ventricles. The P-wave is often used as a reference point to help interpret the other ECG components and to identify potential abnormalities in the heart's electrical activity.", "gold": "atrial depolarization",

"The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was not made into an amendment to the United States Constitution. It was a federal law passed by the 39th United States Congress, which was in effect from 1865 to 1870. The law was enacted to protect the rights of African Americans in the newly formed United States.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866 was a landmark piece of legislation that:\n\n1. **Abolished slavery**: The law prohibited the ownership of slaves in the United States.\n2. **Protected African American rights**: It guaranteed the right to vote, own property, and access education and employment opportunities for African Americans.\n3. **Established citizenship**: The law defined citizenship and guaranteed equal protection under the law for all citizens, regardless of race.\n\nHowever, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was not ratified as a constitutional amendment. The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which abolished slavery, was ratified on December 6, 1865. The 14th Amendment, which granted citizenship to former slaves and guaranteed equal protection under the law, was ratified on July 9, 1868.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866 was repealed by the 15th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was ratified on March 30, 1870. The 15th Amendment states: \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was an important step towards achieving civil rights for African Americans, but it was not a constitutional amendment. The United States Constitution does not have a specific article or amendment dedicated to civil rights, although it does provide a framework for protecting individual rights and freedoms.", "gold": "<P> Senator Lyman Trumbull was the Senate sponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , and he argued that Congress had power to enact it in order to eliminate a discriminatory `` badge of servitude '' prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment . Representative John Bingham , principal author of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment , was one of several Republicans who believed ( prior to that Amendment ) that Congress lacked power to pass the 1866 Act . In the 20th century , the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately adopted Trumbull 's Thirteenth Amendment rationale for congressional power to ban racial discrimination by states and by private parties , in

Here's a brief overview:\n\n**Original Route (1883-1914):**\n\nThe Orient Express was first introduced in 1883 by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL), a French company that operated a network of passenger trains across Europe.

He was tasked with bringing American settlers to the region and establishing a colony.\n\nAustin's efforts led to the establishment of the first permanent settlement in Texas, which he named San Antonio. He also played a key role in the colonization of other areas, including the Rio Grande Valley and the Gulf Coast.\n\nAustin's legacy extends beyond his role in Texas history. He is also remembered for his role in the early days of the United States, as he traveled extensively throughout the country, establishing trade relationships and promoting American interests.\n\nSome of his notable achievements include:\n\n1. Establishing the first permanent settlement in Texas\n2. Bringing American settlers to the region\n3. Establishing the first trade relationships with Native American tribes\n4. Promoting American interests in the region\n5. Playing a key role in the early days of the United States\n\nAustin's legacy has been recognized and celebrated in various ways, including:\n\n1.

Here's a brief overview of their location:\n\n1. **Geographical Location**: The Bible describes Sodom and Gomorrah as being situated near the Dead Sea, which is the lowest point on Earth, with an elevation of approximately 429 meters (1,405 feet) above sea level. The cities are located on the west bank of the Jordan River, near the border with the land of Moab (modern-day Jordan).\n\n2. **Specific Location**: According to Genesis 13:10-12, Sodom and Gomorrah were located in the region of the Dead Sea, near the city of Admah, which is mentioned as being situated on the east side of the Dead Sea. This would place Sodom and Gomorrah approximately 150-200 kilometers (93-124 miles) west of Jerusalem.\n\n3. **Exact Coordinates**: The exact coordinates of Sodom and Gomorrah are not specified in the Bible. However, based on archaeological findings and historical records, the cities are believed to have been located near the modern-day city of Hebron, which is situated in the region of the Dead Sea.\n\n4. **Map Representation**: In the Bible, Sodom and Gomorrah are described as being situated near the Jordan River, with the cities being surrounded by a deep and dry valley. This is consistent with the biblical account of the cities being destroyed by a flood, as described in Genesis 19:24.\n\nHere's a rough outline of the biblical account:\n\n- Genesis 13:10-12: Sodom and Gomorrah are described as two cities located on the west bank of the Jordan River, near the border with the land of Moab.\n- Genesis 18:20-33: Sodom and Gomorrah are described as two cities that are destroyed by God due to their wickedness.\n- Genesis 19:1-29: The story of Sodom and Gomorrah is described in detail, including the destruction of the cities and the fate of their inhabitants.\n\nPlease note that the exact location of Sodom and Gomorrah has been a topic of debate among scholars and archaeologists, with some arguing that they may have been located in different areas.

der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft", "answer": "The moral of the ant and the grasshopper is a famous fable attributed to Aesop, which conveys a valuable lesson about the importance of preparation and responsibility. Here's a brief summary:\n\nThe story goes like this:\n\nA grasshopper and an ant are out in the sun, and the grasshopper is too lazy to prepare for the winter. The ant, on the other hand, works hard all summer to store food and build a home.\n\nWhen winter comes, the ant is prepared and has enough food to sustain itself and its family. The grasshopper, however, is hungry and freezes to death.\n\nThe moral of the story is that preparation and hard work can lead to success and prosperity, while laziness and not preparing for the future can lead to failure and hardship.\n\nThis moral can be applied to many aspects of life, such as:\n\n* Hard work and preparation can lead to financial success and security.\n* Laziness and procrastination can lead to missed opportunities and financial difficulties.\n* Planning and preparation can help you achieve your goals and overcome challenges.\n* Being responsible and prepared for the future can help you navigate life's uncertainties and achieve your dreams.\n\nThis fable has been interpreted in many ways, and its message remains relevant today. It encourages individuals to take responsibility for their own lives and to make the most of their opportunities.", "gold": "<P> The story has been used to teach the virtues of hard work and the perils of improvidence . Some versions state a moral at the end along the lines of `` Idleness brings want '' , `` To work today is to eat tomorrow '' , `` Beware of winter before it comes '' . In La Fontaine 's Fables no final judgment is made , although it has been argued that the author is there making sly fun of his own notoriously improvident ways . But the point of view in most retellings of the fable is supportive of the ant . It is also influenced by the commendation in the biblical Book of Proverbs , which mentions the ant twice . The first proverb admonishes , `` Go to the ant , you sluggard ! Consider her ways and be wise , which having no captain , overseer or ruler , provides her supplies in the summer , and gathers her food in the harvest '' ( 6.6 - 9 ) . Later , in a parallel saying of Agur , the insects figure among the ' four things that are little upon the earth but they are exceeding wise . The ants are a people not strong , yet they provide their food in the summer .

He believed that the soul is a non-physical entity that animates the body.\n\n3. **Ren\u00e9 Descartes** (1596-1650): Descartes' famous statement \"I think, therefore I am\" (Cogito, ergo sum) is often seen as a foundational text of modern philosophy, including the mind-body dualism theory. He believed that the mind is a non-physical entity that interacts with the body.\n\n4. **Immanuel Kant** (1724-1804): Kant's philosophical works, particularly \"Critique of Pure Reason,\" laid the groundwork for modern philosophical debates on the mind-body dualism. He argued that the mind is a non-physical entity that interacts with the body through the senses.\n\n5. **David Hume** (1711-1776): Hume's philosophical works, such as \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding,\" explored the relationship between the mind and the body. He argued that the mind is a non-physical entity that interacts with the body through the senses.\n\nThese philosophers, along with others, have contributed to the development of the mind-body dualism

The exact scene is not specified in the book, but it is described as a pivotal moment in the story.\n\nIn the novel, the creature is awakened by Victor Frankenstein's experiments in his laboratory, and it emerges from the laboratory, confused and disoriented. Victor Frankenstein is initially unaware of the creature's existence and is shocked by its appearance.\n\nThe creature's first encounter with Victor Frankenstein is a moment of confrontation and discovery. Victor Frankenstein is shocked to see the creature, and the creature is equally surprised to see the scientist who created it. This initial meeting sets the stage for the complex and often tumultuous relationship between Victor Frankenstein and the creature.\n\nIt's worth noting that the film adaptation of \"Frankenstein\" directed by James Whale (1931) and later directed by Kenneth Branagh (1994) and Frank Miller's \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) also depicts the creature meeting Victor Frankenstein.
