He is depicted as a wise and powerful leader, who values loyalty, honor, and martial prowess. Charlemagne is often shown to be a just ruler, but also fiercely protective of his kingdom and his people.\n\nThroughout the poem, Charlemagne is shown to be a skilled military strategist and a charismatic leader, who inspires loyalty and devotion in his knights. He is particularly close to his nephew, Roland, whom he regards as his heir.\n\nHowever, Charlemagne is also shown to be vulnerable to the machinations of his enemies, particularly the treacherous Ganelon, who betrays Roland and the Frankish army. Charlemagne's grief and rage at Roland's death serve as a catalyst for the rest of the poem, as he vows to avenge his nephew's death and restore honor to the Frankish kingdom.\n\nOverall, Charlemagne in \"The Song of Roland\" is a complex and nuanced character, embodying both the virtues of a great leader and the flaws of human fallibility.", "gold": [-1], "metrics": {}},{"question": "when did power rangers tv show come out", "context": "", "answer": "The original \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers\" TV show first aired on August 28, 1993.", "gold": "August 28 , 1993", "metrics": {"bleu": 8.844844403089351e-232, "rouge-1": 0.35294117647058826, "rouge-L": 0.35294117647058826, "semantic-similarity": 0.31731632351875305}},{"question": "inheritance of the a b o blood groups is an example of", "context": "", "answer": "Inheritance of the ABO blood groups is an example of a simple Mendelian inheritance pattern, specifically an autosomal dominant pattern.", "gold": "<Table> <Tr> <Td colspan=\"8\"> Blood group inheritance </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Blood type </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> O </Th> <Th colspan=\"2\"> </Th> <Th colspan=\"2\"> </Th> <Th> AB </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Th> Genotype </Th> <Th> ii ( OO ) </Th> <Th> I i ( AO ) </Th> <Th> I I ( AA ) </Th> <Th> I i ( BO ) </Th> <Th> I I ( BB ) </Th> <Th> I I ( AB ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> O </Td> <Td> ii ( OO ) </Td> <Td> O OO OO OO OO </Td> <Td> O or A AO OO AO OO </Td> <Td> AO AO AO AO </Td> <Td> O or B BO OO BO OO </Td> <Td> BO BO BO BO </Td> <Td> A or B AO BO AO BO </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> I i ( AO ) </Td> <Td> O or A AO AO OO OO </Td> <Td> O or A AA AO AO OO </Td> <Td> AA AA AO AO </Td> <Td> O , A , B or AB AB AO BO OO </Td> <Td> B or AB AB AB BO BO </Td> <Td> A , B or AB AA AB AO BO </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> I I ( AA ) </Td> <Td> AO AO AO AO </Td> <Td> AA AO AA AO </Td> <Td> AA AA AA AA </Td> <Td> A or AB AB AO AB AO </Td> <Td> AB AB AB AB AB </Td> <Td> A or AB AA AB AA AB </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> I i ( BO ) </Td> <Td> O or B BO BO OO OO </Td> <Td> O , A , B or AB AB BO AO OO </Td> <Td> A or AB AB AB AO AO </Td> <Td> O or B BB BO BO OO </Td> <Td> BB BB BO BO </Td> <Td> A , B or AB AB BB AO BO </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> I I ( BB ) </Td> <Td> BO BO BO BO </Td> <Td> B or AB AB BO AB BO </Td> <Td> AB AB AB AB AB </Td> <Td> BB BO BB BO </Td> <Td> BB BB BB BB </Td> <Td> B or AB AB BB AB BB </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> AB </Td> <Td> I I ( AB ) </Td> <Td> A or B AO AO BO BO </Td> <Td> A , B or AB AA AO AB BO </Td> <Td> A or AB AA AA AB AB </Td> <Td> A , B or AB AB AO BB BO </Td> <Td> B or AB AB AB BB BB </Td> <Td> A , B , or AB AA AB AB BB </Td> </Tr> </Table>", "metrics": {"bleu": 1.0003688322288243e-231, "rouge-1": 0.018306636155606407, "rouge-L": 0.013729977116704805, "semantic-similarity": 0.5167012214660645}},{"question": "how many beverly hills cops movies are there", "context": "", "answer": "There are four Beverly Hills Cop movies:\n\n1.
