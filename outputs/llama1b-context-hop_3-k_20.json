One possible source is the Coca-Cola Company's advertising campaigns, which used the slogan \"The Pause That Refreshes\" and featured a glass of Coke with a straw.\n\nHowever, the phrase \"I owe you a Coke\" gained popularity after it was used by a customer at a gas station in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1976. According to the story, the customer was in a hurry and didn't have time to pay for a Coke. A stranger offered to buy it for him, saying, \"I owe you a Coke.\"\n\nThis phrase was later adopted by the public, and it eventually became a common expression used to express gratitude or apology. Over time, the phrase has taken on a broader meaning, encompassing not just a financial transaction but also a sense of obligation or debt.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Coca-Cola Company has acknowledged the phrase's origins and has even used it in their advertising campaigns. In 2013, the company even released a series of ads featuring people saying \"I owe you a Coke\" in a humorous and relatable way.\n\nSo, in short, the phrase \"I owe you a Coke\" has its roots in a 1976 customer encounter at a gas station, but it has since become a widely recognized expression of gratitude and apology.", "gold": "Jinx is a children 's game with varying rules and penalties that occur when two people unintentionally speak the same word or phrase simultaneously", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.422422201544919e-232, "rouge-1": 0.07246376811594202, "rouge-L": 0.06521739130434782, "semantic-similarity": 0.17371001839637756}},{"question": "where does the last name hickey come from", "context": "", "answer": "The surname Hickey is of Irish origin.

Over time, the name spread to other parts of the world, including the United States.\n\nAs a surname, Hickey is often associated with the Hickey family, who were prominent landowners in Ireland and the United States. The surname is also found in other countries, such as Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the surname's possible origins:\n\n* \"Hickey\" is thought to be a variant of the Gaelic surname \"\u00d3 h\u00cdceadha\" or \"\u00cdceadha.\"\n* \"\u00d3\" is a patronymic prefix, indicating that the original bearer was the son of someone named Iochaidh.\n* \"Hickey\" or \"\u00cdceadha\" may have been a personal name or a title.\n\nKeep in mind that the origins of surnames can be complex and nuanced, and different sources may provide varying explanations for the surname's origins.", "gold": "Irish origin", "metrics": {"bleu": 0, "rouge-1": 0.020618556701030924, "rouge-L": 0.020618556701030924, "semantic-similarity": 0.4490475058555603}},{"question": "where do lie bumps come from on your tongue", "context": "", "answer": "Lie bumps, also known as lingual papillae, are small, bumps on the surface of the tongue. They are typically found on the sides and back of the tongue, but can also be found on the front and top. These bumps are usually harmless and are a normal part of the tongue's anatomy.\n\nThe bumps are formed by small projections of the tongue's surface, which are made of keratin, a tough protein. They are usually about 1-2 mm in size and are covered with tiny little bumps called papillae.\n\nLie bumps are more common in people with a smaller tongue size or those who have a more prominent tongue shape. They can also be affected by certain health conditions, such as:\n\n* Gingivitis (inflammation of the gums)\n* Periodontitis (inflammation of the gums and surrounding tissues)\n* Oral thrush (a fungal infection)\n* Certain medications\n\nIn most cases, lie bumps are not a cause for concern and can be easily removed with a toothbrush or a tongue scraper.", "gold": "<P> The name `` lie bumps '' is a result of a myth that telling lies would cause them .

As this cold air moves forward, it encounters warmer air from the previous layer of air, causing the air to rise. This rising air cools, and as it cools, it condenses into tiny water droplets or ice crystals, forming clouds.\n\nThe process of cloud formation is called condensation, and it occurs when the air is cooled to its dew point, which is the temperature at which the air becomes saturated with water vapor and can no longer hold any more moisture.\n\nIn the case of a cold front, the rising air is typically cooler than the surrounding air, so it cools and condenses, forming clouds. This is why cold fronts often produce clouds, especially cumulus clouds, which can grow into towering thunderstorms if the conditions are right.\n\nHere's a simplified explanation of the process:\n\n1. Cold air moves into an area.\n2. The cold air cools, and the air above it rises.\n3. As the air rises, it cools and condenses, forming clouds.\n4. The cloud forms when the air is cooled to its dew point.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simplified explanation, and there are many other factors that can influence cloud formation, such as wind direction, humidity, and the presence of other atmospheric conditions.", "gold": "<Table> <Tr> <Th> Weather phenomenon </Th> <Th> Prior to the passing of the front </Th> <Th> While the front is passing </Th> <Th> After the passing of the front </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Temperature </Td> <Td> Warm </Td> <Td> Cooling suddenly </Td> <Td> Steadily cooling </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Atmospheric pressure </Td> <Td> Decreasing steadily </Td> <Td> Lowest , then sudden increase </Td> <Td> Increasing steadily </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Winds </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Southwest to southeast ( northern hemisphere ) </Li> <Li> Northwest to northeast ( southern hemisphere ) </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> Gusty ; shifting </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> North to west , usually northwest ( northern hemisphere ) </Li> <Li> South to west , usually southwest ( southern hemisphere ) </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Precipitation / conditions * </Td> <Td> Light patchy rain can be produced by stratocumulus or stratus in the warm sector .

Be a resident of the United States for at least 14 years.\n\nHowever, the Constitution does not explicitly state that the President must be born in the United States. The phrase \"natural-born citizen\" is often interpreted to mean someone who was born in the United States, but it can be argued that it could also refer to someone who was born abroad to parents who are United States citizens.\n\nIn practice, the President's birthplace is typically considered to be the state or territory where they were born. For example, John F. Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, and Bill Clinton was born in Hope, Arkansas. However, the Constitution does not require the President to be born in the state where they were born.\n\nIt's worth noting that the concept of \"natural-born citizen\" is not as clear-cut as it might seem. The Supreme Court has ruled that a person can be a \"natural-born citizen\" if they:\n\n* Was born abroad to parents who are United States citizens\n* Was born in the United States to parents who are not United States citizens\n* Was born in the United States to a parent who is not a United States citizen\n\nUltimately, the interpretation of the phrase \"natural-born citizen\" has been the subject of much debate and litigation over the years.", "gold": "<P> Status as a natural - born citizen of the United States is one of the eligibility requirements established in the United States Constitution for holding the office of President or Vice President .

These phrases are derived from the number systems used in ancient Babylon and other civilizations.\n\nIn the Babylonian system, the number 12 was divided into two equal parts: 6 and 6 (or 12 and 6). This system was used for counting and calculating purposes. Similarly, in the Roman system, the number 12 was divided into two equal parts: 6 and 6 (or 12 and 6).\n\nAs a result, the terms \"sixes and sevens\" and \"twos and eights\" were used to describe the number of each part of a set of twelve. In modern English, these phrases have evolved to be used figuratively to describe situations where two opposing forces or elements are in balance, or where two equal parts are being compared.\n\nFor example, \"sixes and sevens\" can be used to describe a situation where two opposing forces are in balance, such as a trade-off between two equally important factors. Similarly, \"twos and eights\" can be used to describe a situation where two equal parts are being compared, such as a balance between two equal components of a system.", "gold": "<P> An ancient dispute between the Merchant Taylors and Skinners livery companies is the probable origin of the phrase .

This approach was contrasted with traditional bequest ( patrimony ) , where wealth is handed down to heirs , and other forms of bequest e.g. where wealth is willed to the state for public purposes . Carnegie argued that poor people put to best use ( i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society ) when it is administered carefully by the poor . Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance , irresponsible spending , or self - indulgence , instead promoting the administration of said capital over the course of one 's lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor .

The ant works hard to store food for the winter, while the grasshopper spends his time singing and playing, expecting others to take care of him.\n\n2. **Responsibility and preparedness are key**: The ant's hard work and preparation ultimately lead to his success, while the grasshopper's lack of preparation and responsibility lead to his downfall.\n\n3. **Pride and entitlement can lead to failure**: The grasshopper's pride and entitlement lead him to believe that others will take care of him, and he doesn't put in the effort to prepare for the future. This ultimately results in his failure.\n\n4. **The value of hard work and responsibility**: The story emphasizes the importance of hard work, responsibility, and self-reliance. It shows that with determination and effort, individuals can achieve their goals and succeed.\n\n5. **The consequences of procrastination**: The story also warns about the consequences of procrastination and not taking responsibility for one's actions. The grasshopper's lack of preparation and responsibility lead to his isolation and eventual demise.\n\nThe moral of \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\" can be applied to various aspects of life, such as:\n\n* Education: The story teaches children the importance of hard work, preparation, and responsibility in achieving their goals.\n* Financial planning: The story highlights the importance of saving and preparing for the future, especially during times of economic uncertainty.\n* Personal growth: The story encourages individuals to take responsibility for their actions, work hard, and strive for self-improvement.\n\nOverall, \"The Ant and the Grasshopper\" is a timeless tale that teaches valuable lessons about the importance of hard work, responsibility, and self-reliance.", "gold": "<P> The story has been used to teach the virtues of hard work and the perils of improvidence .

However, the most prominent figure associated with this idea is:\n\n1. **Ren\u00e9 Descartes** (1596-1650): In his work \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" (1641), Descartes argued that the mind is a separate entity from the body and that the mind's existence cannot be proven through sensory experience. He famously stated, \"I think, therefore I am\" (Cogito, ergo sum), which is often referred to as the \"Cogito\" or \"I think, therefore I am\" principle.\n\n2. **John Locke** (1632-1704): Locke, an English philosopher, argued in his work \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1689) that the mind is a tabula rasa, or a blank slate, at birth, and that our experiences and perceptions shape our understanding of the world. He believed that the mind is a product of the interactions between the body and the environment.\n\n3. **David Hume** (1711-1776): Hume, a Scottish philosopher, also contributed to the development of this idea. In his work \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\" (1748), he argued that our understanding of the world is shaped by our experiences, memories, and perceptions, rather than by any innate knowledge or ideas.\n\n4. **Immanuel Kant** (1724-1804): Kant, a German philosopher, developed a more nuanced view of the mind-body problem in his work \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781). He argued that the mind plays an active role in shaping our understanding of the world, but that the mind's influence is not as direct or causal as Descartes suggested.\n\nThese philosophers, along with others, have contributed to the development of the mind-body problem, which remains a central issue in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience.", "gold": "Ren\u00e9 Descartes", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.140001577715776e-232, "rouge-1": 0.01384083044982699, "rouge-L": 0.01384083044982699, "semantic-similarity": 0.26007258892059326}},{"question": "how many goals scored ronaldo in his career", "context": " Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) National-Football-Teams.com player ID 990\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online ID biography/Ronaldo\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) given name Ronaldo\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) award received UEFA Club Footballer of the Year\n Ronaldinho total goals in career +3\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) total goals in career +0\n Cristiano Ronaldo total goals in career +7\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) FIFA player ID (archived) 92699\n Ronaldinho total goals in career +0\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) different from Ronaldo\n Ronaldo different from Ronaldo\n Cristiano Ronaldo total goals in career +2\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) total goals in career +1", "answer": "Ronaldo scored a total of 819 goals in his career.", "gold": "over 670", "metrics": {"bleu": 0, "rouge-1": 0.0, "rouge-L": 0.0, "semantic-similarity": 0.1567094475030899}},{"question": "how long has house of payne been on tv", "context": " What's in a Payne Name part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n When the Payne's Away part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne instance of television series\n Recurring Paynes season Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 6\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 3 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 6 has part(s) When the Payne's Away\n It's a Payne Growing Up part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne genre comedy television series\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 4 instance of television series season\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 1 instance of television series season\n Payne, Payne Go Away part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n House Guest part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 6 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Recurring Paynes part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 1 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 6 instance of television series season\n No More Payne part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne genre American television sitcom\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 6 has part(s) Recurring Paynes\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 4 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne", "answer": "Tyler Perry's House of Payne premiered on July 7, 2006, on TBS.
