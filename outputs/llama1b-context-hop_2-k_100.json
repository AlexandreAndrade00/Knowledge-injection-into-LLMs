Chloris (\u03a7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2). She was the daughter of Zephyr (\u0396\u03ad\u03c6\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) and Terra (\u03a4erra), the goddess of the earth. Chloris was often depicted as a beautiful young woman with a sprig of flowers in her hand, symbolizing the arrival of spring.\n\nChloris was associated with the season of spring, growth, and fertility. She was said to bloom in the gardens of the gods, particularly in the Gardens of the Hesperides, and her presence was believed to bring forth new life and vitality.\n\nIn addition to her association with Chloris, the goddess of spring growth, other gods and goddesses were also linked to the season. For example, Demeter (\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1) was the goddess of agriculture and fertility, and her absence was often depicted as a sign of winter's decline and the arrival of spring.\n\nThe Greek word \"chloros\" (\u03a7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2) is also related to the word \"chlorophyll,\" the green pigment that helps plants grow and thrive. This connection highlights the close relationship between Chloris and the natural world, and her role as a goddess of spring growth is still celebrated in many modern cultures.", "gold": "Persephone ( / p\u0259r\u02c8s\u025bf\u0259ni / ; Greek : \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03c6\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7 ) , also called Kore ( / \u02c8k\u0254\u02d0ri\u02d0 / ; `` the maiden '' )", "metrics": {"bleu": 6.65238984402547e-232, "rouge-1": 0.04020100502512563, "rouge-L": 0.04020100502512563, "semantic-similarity": 0.3194621205329895}},{"question": "how many season of the man in the high castle", "context": "", "answer": "There are 4 seasons of the TV series 'The Man in the High Castle'.

debate among scholars, as there are many significant texts in Jewish history and culture. However, some of the most influential and widely accepted candidates include:\n\n1. **The Torah** (also known as the Five Books of Moses): The first five books of the Hebrew Bible, which contain the core teachings and stories of the Jewish faith.\n2. **The Talmud**: A collection of oral traditions and commentaries on the Torah, compiled by Jewish scholars in the Middle Ages. It is considered one of the most important texts in Jewish tradition and has had a profound impact on Jewish law and culture.\n3. **The Mishnah**: A compilation of Jewish oral traditions and teachings, based on the Talmud, which was written in the 2nd century CE. It is considered one of the most important texts in Jewish law and tradition.\n4. **The Zohar**: A mystical text written in the 13th century CE, which explores the nature of God and the universe through symbolism and allegory.\n5. **The Targum**: A translation of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, which was used by Jewish scholars to study and interpret the text.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose one text that stands out as particularly important, I would say it's the **Torah**.

October 1, 1949, by the Communist Party of China (CPC), led by Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong declared the establishment of the PRC, marking the end of the Nationalist government's (KMT) rule and the beginning of a socialist state.\n\nMao Zedong and the CPC had been in power in China since 1927, and in 1945, they launched the Long March, a 6,000-mile journey from southern China to the north to defeat the Nationalist government. After the defeat of the KMT in 1949, the CPC established the PRC and began to consolidate power.\n\nThe founding of the PRC was formalized with the issuance of the \"Founding of the People's Republic of China\" document, signed by Mao Zedong, on October 1, 1949.

This warm air is unable to hold its temperature, so it rises, creating an area of low pressure near the ground.\n2. **Warm air rises**: As the warm air rises, it cools, and its water vapor condenses into clouds. This process is known as orographic lift, and it occurs when air is forced to rise over a mountain or a valley.\n3. **Clouds form**: As the warm air rises, it cools, and its water vapor condenses into visible clouds, such as cumulus, stratocumulus, or nimbus clouds.\n4. **Clouds become saturated**: As more warm air is pushed forward, the clouds become saturated with water vapor. This causes the clouds to become heavy and develop precipitation, such as rain or snow.\n\nThe specific type of cloud that forms in response to a cold front depends on the temperature and humidity of the air. Here are some common cloud types that can form in response to a cold front:\n\n* **Cumulus clouds**: These are puffy, white clouds that can grow into towering cumulus or thunderstorms.\n* **Stratocumulus clouds**: These are low-level clouds that are made up of a series of rounded, lumpy clouds that are often seen in coastal areas.\n* **Nimbus clouds**: These are dark, rain-bearing clouds that can produce heavy precipitation and thunderstorms.\n* **Altostratus clouds**: These are mid-level clouds that are made up of a uniform gray or blue-gray color and can produce light to moderate precipitation.\n\nOverall, the formation of clouds in response to a cold front is a complex process that involves the movement of air and the cooling of the air as it rises.", "gold": "<Table> <Tr> <Th> Weather phenomenon </Th> <Th> Prior to the passing of the front </Th> <Th> While the front is passing </Th> <Th> After the passing of the front </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Temperature </Td> <Td> Warm </Td> <Td> Cooling suddenly </Td> <Td> Steadily cooling </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Atmospheric pressure </Td> <Td> Decreasing steadily </Td> <Td> Lowest , then sudden increase </Td> <Td> Increasing steadily </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Winds </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Southwest to southeast ( northern hemisphere ) </Li> <Li> Northwest to northeast ( southern hemisphere ) </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> Gusty ; shifting </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> North to west , usually northwest ( northern hemisphere ) </Li> <Li> South to west , usually southwest ( southern hemisphere ) </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Precipitation / conditions * </Td> <Td> Light patchy rain can be produced by stratocumulus or stratus in the warm sector .

Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Court funding**: The court system, specifically the Wayne County Circuit Court in Michigan, pays for the show through a contract with Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. The show is a court show, and the court system provides the courtrooms, judges, and other necessary resources.\n2. **Judge Mathis' fee**: The show is produced by Warner Bros. and is paid for by the court system. The amount of the fee is not publicly disclosed, but it's reportedly a significant amount.\n3. **Production costs**: Warner Bros. also covers production costs, such as the cost of filming, editing, and other expenses associated with producing the show.\n4. **Revenue sharing**: The court system likely shares some revenue from the show with Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. as a way to offset the costs of producing the show.\n\nIt's worth noting that the show is a court show, and the primary purpose is to provide a platform for judges to resolve disputes and make decisions in a fair and impartial manner. The show's focus is on providing a service to the court system and the community, rather than generating revenue for the individuals involved in the show.\n\nIn an interview, Judge Mathis himself mentioned that the show is funded by the court system and that he doesn't receive any payment for his time or appearance on the show.

This means that the person must be a U.S. citizen from birth, either by being born in the United States or by being born abroad to parents who are U.S. citizens.\n\nHowever, the Constitution does not explicitly state that the person must be born in the United States. It only mentions that the person must be a \"natural-born citizen\" of the United States.\n\nThe concept of \"natural-born citizen\" is often interpreted to mean that the person must have been a U.S. citizen from birth, but this is not a clear or definitive definition. There is no clear answer to this question, and it has been the subject of much debate and discussion over the years.\n\nIn practice, the term \"natural-born citizen\" is often used to describe someone who was born in the United States to U.S. citizen parents or was born abroad to U.S. citizen parents who became naturalized U.S. citizens. However, this is not a constitutional requirement, and the Constitution does not provide a clear definition of what it means to be a \"natural-born citizen.\"\n\nSome notable examples of natural-born citizens include:\n\n* George Washington (born in Westmoreland County, Virginia)\n* Thomas Jefferson (born in Shadwell, Virginia)\n* Theodore Roosevelt (born in New York City, New York)\n* Franklin D. Roosevelt (born in Hyde Park, New York)\n* John F. Kennedy (born in Brookline, Massachusetts)\n* Barack Obama (born in Honolulu, Hawaii)\n\nOn the other hand, some notable examples of individuals who were not born in the United States but became naturalized citizens include:\n\n* John Quincy Adams (born in Braintree, Massachusetts, but raised in England)\n* Abraham Lincoln (born in Kentucky, but raised in Indiana)\n* Martin Van Buren (born in Kinderhook, New York, but raised in Kinderhook)\n* Grover Cleveland (born in Caldwell, New Jersey, but raised in New Jersey)\n* Woodrow Wilson (born in Staunton, Virginia, but raised in Virginia)\n\nIt's worth noting that the concept of \"natural-born citizen\" is often used as a catch-all phrase to describe someone who is a U.S. citizen from birth, regardless of whether they were born in the United States or abroad. However, this is not a clear or definitive definition, and the Constitution does not provide a clear answer to this question.", "gold": "<P> Status as a natural - born citizen of the United States is one of the eligibility requirements established in the United States Constitution for holding the office of President or Vice President .

attributed to a character in the 1964 film \"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,\" where a character named Major T.J. \"King\" Kong says:\n\n\"The British are coming. The British are coming. The British are coming. Get me a bottle of whiskey, and a rope, and a map, and a plan. And get me out of here!\"\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the phrase is likely a paraphrased version of a real conversation between the film's writer and director, Stanley Kubrick, and his producer, Alex Loog Oldham.\n\nIn an interview, Kubrick explained that he was inspired by a conversation he had with a friend, who was a British intelligence officer. The friend told him that the British were always getting nervous when they thought the Americans were going to attack, and he said, \"The British are coming. The British are coming. The British are coming.\" Kubrick liked the phrase and used it in his film, adapting it to fit the context of the movie.\n\nSo, while it's difficult to pinpoint a specific person who \"warned\" the British that the British were coming, it's clear that the phrase was inspired by a conversation between Kubrick and his friend, and was later adapted and used in the film.", "gold": "Samuel Prescott",

According to Article III, Section 1 of the US Constitution, the Court consists of nine justices, who are elected by the people through the Electoral College system. This means that the President of the United States appoints the justices, but the Senate then confirms their appointments.\n\nHere's a brief overview of the process:\n\n1. The President nominates a candidate for the Court.\n2. The candidate is then put to a vote by the Senate, with two-thirds of the Senate (at least 67 votes) required for confirmation.\n3. If the Senate confirms the nominee, the nominee becomes a justice on the Court.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Senate's confirmation process can be contentious, and it's not uncommon for justices to be confirmed with a single vote in the Senate.

The MCC was then enacted in 2003, under the Public Service (Amendment) Act, 2003.\n* In the United Kingdom, the MCC was introduced in 2004, as part of the Civil Service Reform Act 2004.\n* In Australia, the MCC was introduced in 2011, as part of the Public Service Act 2010.\n* In Canada, the MCC was introduced in 2012, as part of the Public Service Act, 2012.\n\nIn general, the MCC is introduced as a model code, and then the relevant laws and regulations are enacted to implement the guidelines. The MCC is usually introduced in the following stages:\n\n1. Model Code is introduced: The MCC is introduced as a model code, which provides a framework for the behavior of public servants.\n2. Laws are enacted: The relevant laws and regulations are enacted to implement the guidelines outlined in the MCC.\n3. Implementation phase: The MCC is implemented, and public servants are expected to adhere to the guidelines outlined in the code.\n\nIt's worth noting that the MCC is not a law, but rather a model code that guides the behavior of public servants.

The Babylonians used a sexagesimal system to count and measure time, and the number six was likely chosen because it is a multiple of 6 (6 x 1 = 6).

In Egyptian numerals, the number seven was written as \"shesh,\" which is derived from the ancient Egyptian word for \"seven.\"\n\nThe use of these numbers in everyday life, particularly in timekeeping, is believed to have originated in ancient Mesopotamia around 2000 BCE.

Carnegie Freebase ID /m/050f2y", "answer": "Andrew Carnegie's \"The Gospel of Wealth\" (1899) is a philosophical and economic treatise that presents a comprehensive critique of capitalism and advocates for a more equitable and sustainable economic system. The central contention of the book can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Critique of Capitalism:**\n\n1. **Income inequality:** Carnegie argues that capitalism creates vast wealth disparities, as the wealthy accumulate more and more, while the poor and middle class struggle to make ends meet.\n2. **Exploitation:** He claims that capitalists exploit workers, paying them less than the value of their labor, and that this exploitation is morally wrong.\n3. **Unsustainable growth:** Carnegie suggests that unchecked capitalism can lead to environmental degradation, social unrest, and economic instability.\n\n**Alternative Economic System:**\n\n1. **Socialism:** Carnegie advocates for a socialist system, where the means of production are collectively owned, and resources are allocated based on need rather than profit.\n2. **Cooperative ownership:** He proposes that cooperatives, where workers collectively own and manage businesses, can provide a more equitable and sustainable economic system.\n3. **Public ownership:** Carnegie also suggests that public ownership of key industries, such as railroads and utilities, can ensure that essential services are available to all, rather than being controlled by private interests.\n\n**Key Principles:**\n\n1. **Equality:** Carnegie advocates for a more equal distribution of wealth and resources, where the wealthy are taxed at a higher rate to fund public services and support the poor.\n2. **Social welfare:** He believes that a well-functioning economy should prioritize social welfare and the well-being of all citizens, rather than just the interests of the wealthy.\n3. **Environmental sustainability:** Carnegie emphasizes the importance of preserving natural resources and promoting sustainable economic growth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n\"The Gospel of Wealth\" concludes that a more equitable and sustainable economic system is possible through a combination of social welfare, public ownership, and environmental sustainability. Carnegie's vision for a more just and prosperous society is based on the idea that economic growth and development should serve the common good, rather than just the interests of the wealthy.", "gold": "<P> `` Wealth '' , more commonly known as `` The Gospel of Wealth '' , is an article written by Andrew Carnegie in June of 1889 that describes the responsibility of philanthropy by the new upper class of self - made rich . Carnegie proposed to his wife using the best way of dealing with the new phenomenon of wealth inequality was for the wealthy to redistribute their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner . This approach was contrasted with traditional bequest ( patrimony ) , where wealth is handed down to heirs , and other forms of bequest e.g. where wealth is willed to the state for public purposes . Carnegie argued that poor people put to best use ( i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society ) when it is administered carefully by the poor . Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance , irresponsible spending , or self - indulgence , instead promoting the administration of said capital over the course of one 's lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor . As a result , the wealthy should administer their riches responsibly and not in a way that encourages `` the slothful , the drunken , the unworthy '' . </P>", "metrics": {"bleu": 6.663523589827396e-232, "rouge-1": 0.31894934333958724, "rouge-L": 0.17636022514071295, "semantic-similarity": 0.7409323453903198}},{"question": "when did now thats what i call music come out", "context": "", "answer": "\"Now That's What I Call Music\" is a series of compilation albums released by Sony Music.

Constitution. It was actually a federal law passed by the 39th United States Congress, which was signed into law by President Andrew Johnson on May 10, 1866.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866 was a significant piece of legislation that addressed the issue of racial segregation and discrimination in the United States. It prohibited the states from denying anyone equal protection under the law, which is a fundamental principle of the Constitution.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866 was enacted in response to the harsh treatment of African Americans in the post-Civil War South, particularly in the state of Mississippi, where African Americans were subjected to widespread violence, intimidation, and economic exploitation. The law was also influenced by the Civil War-era Reconstruction era, when the federal government sought to establish a new social and economic order in the South.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866 was not ratified as a constitutional amendment because it did not meet the necessary requirements for amendment. The amendment process requires a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, or a national convention called by two-thirds of the state legislatures. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 did not receive the necessary two-thirds majority in either chamber, and therefore it was not ratified as a constitutional amendment.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was not an amendment to the Constitution, but rather a federal law that addressed a specific issue and was intended to promote equality and justice for African Americans.", "gold": "<P> Senator Lyman Trumbull was the Senate sponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , and he argued that Congress had power to enact it in order to eliminate a discriminatory `` badge of servitude '' prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment .

In the 20th century , the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately adopted Trumbull 's Thirteenth Amendment rationale for congressional power to ban racial discrimination by states and by private parties , in view of the fact that the Thirteenth Amendment does not require a state actor . </P>", "metrics": {"bleu": 6.595953379893099e-232, "rouge-1": 0.32653061224489793, "rouge-L": 0.1683673469387755, "semantic-similarity": 0.5414518713951111}},{"question": "what is the original route of the orient express", "context": " train service Wikidata usage instructions A railway service uses several physical railroad tracks or series of tracks.

Nogent-sur-Seine", "answer": "The original route of the Orient Express, also known as the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, was established in 1883 by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (CIWL) and was operated by various companies. The route spanned from Paris to Istanbul (then known as Constantinople), covering a distance of approximately 2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles).\n\nHere's a brief overview of the original route:\n\n**Route Overview:**\n\nThe original route of the Orient Express was designed to follow the main trade routes between Europe and Asia, which were heavily influenced by the Silk Road. The route took passengers from Paris, France, to Istanbul, Turkey, passing through several major cities, including:\n\n1. Paris, France\n2. Lyon, France\n3. Marseille, France\n4. Nice, France\n5. Turin, Italy\n6. Genoa, Italy\n7. Venice, Italy\n8. Trieste, Italy\n9. Budapest, Hungary\n10. Vienna, Austria\n11. Budapest, Hungary (again)\n12. Bucharest, Romania\n13. Istanbul, Turkey\n\n**Route Details:**\n\nThe original route of the Orient Express was approximately 2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles) long and took around 7-10 days to complete. The journey began in Paris and ended in Istanbul, with various stops along the way.\n\nSome notable stops on the original route included:\n\n* Lyon, France (day 1-2)\n* Marseille, France (day 2-3)\n* Nice, France (day 3-4)\n* Turin, Italy (day 4-5)\n* Genoa, Italy (day 5-6)\n* Venice, Italy (day 6-7)\n* Trieste, Italy (day 7-8)\n* Budapest, Hungary (day 8-9)\n* Vienna, Austria (day 9-10)\n* Budapest, Hungary (again) (day 10-11)\n* Bucharest, Romania (day 11-12)\n* Istanbul, Turkey (day 12-13)\n\n**Changes and Discontinuation:**\n\nOver time, the route of the Orient Express underwent several changes, and the service was eventually discontinued in 1963. The last train to run on the original route was the Orient Express, which departed from Istanbul and arrived in Paris on December 27, 1963.\n\nIn 1974, the Orient Express was rebranded as the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, and the route was modified to take passengers from Paris to Istanbul. Today, the Venice-Simplon Orient Express is operated by several companies, including \u00d6BB (Austrian Federal Railways) and SBB (Swiss Federal Railways), and offers a luxurious and nostalgic journey through Europe and Asia.", "gold": "<P> The route and rolling stock of the Orient Express changed many times . Several routes in the past concurrently used the Orient Express name , or slight variations . Although the original Orient Express was simply a normal international railway service , the name became synonymous with intrigue and luxury travel . The two city names most prominently associated with the Orient Express are Paris and Constantinople ( Istanbul ) , the original endpoints of the timetabled service . The Orient Express was a showcase of luxury and comfort at a time when travelling was still rough and dangerous . </P>", "metrics": {"bleu": 6.0980244593628884e-232, "rouge-1": 0.22417582417582418,

In 1668, Redi conducted an experiment using a mixture of flour, water, and yeast, which he observed to cause the mixture to rise. This was the first recorded demonstration of the role of yeast in fermentation.\n\nHowever, it was Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723), a Dutch tradesman and amateur scientist, who first observed yeast fermentation in 1676. He discovered that a mixture of yeast, water, and sugar could produce carbon dioxide gas, which caused the mixture to rise.\n\nThe first written description of yeast fermentation and bread rising was made by the French scientist Pierre Veron (1665-1741). In 1680, Veron published a book titled \"Trait\u00e9 de la fermentation\" (Treatise on Fermentation), in which he described the process of yeast fermentation and its role in bread rising.\n\nThe English scientist Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) is also credited with discovering the role of yeast in fermentation. In 1767, Priestley discovered that yeast could be used to ferment sugar and produce carbon dioxide gas, which caused the mixture to rise. This discovery led to the development of yeast leavening, which is still used today in bread baking.\n\nThe first commercial yeast was developed in the late 18th century by the French scientist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895). Pasteur's discovery of the role of yeast in fermentation led to the development of yeast leavening, which revolutionized the baking industry and enabled the mass production of bread.\n\nOverall, the discovery of yeast's role in fermentation and bread rising was a gradual process that involved the contributions of many scientists over several centuries.", "gold": "<P> The most common source of leavening in antiquity was to retain a piece of dough ( with sugar and water in ) from the previous day to utilize as a form of sourdough starter . Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer to produce `` a lighter kind of bread than other peoples . '' Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of grape must and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting , or wheat bran steeped in wine , as a source for yeast

Establishing the Texas Revolution: Austin was a key figure in the Texas Revolution, which began in 1835. He played a crucial role in organizing the rebels and helping to secure the release of the Texans from the Mexican army.\n2. Founding the city of Austin: Austin was instrumental in the founding of the city of Austin, which was named in his honor.\n3. Promoting the settlement of Texas: Austin worked to attract settlers to the region, and his efforts helped to establish the Texas economy.\n4.

Aesop, is:\n\n**\"Hard work and preparation for the future are essential for success.\"**\n\nThe story goes like this:\n\nA hardworking ant prepares for the winter by storing food and gathering materials. Meanwhile, a grasshopper spends the summer singing and playing, but does not prepare for the winter.\n\nWhen winter comes, the ant is ready and has enough food to eat. The grasshopper, on the other hand, is hungry and cannot find any food.\n\nThe moral of the story is that hard work, preparation, and planning for the future are crucial for success. It warns against the dangers of laziness and inaction, and encourages people to make a plan for the future, just like the ant.\n\nThis fable is often used to teach children about the importance of:\n\n1. Hard work and diligence\n2. Planning and preparation\n3. Saving for the future\n4. Being responsible and responsible for one's actions\n\nThe story has been interpreted in many ways, but its core message remains the same: that preparation and hard work are essential for achieving success and avoiding the consequences of laziness and inaction.", "gold": "<P> The story has been used to teach the virtues of hard work and the perils of improvidence .

But the point of view in most retellings of the fable is supportive of the ant . It is also influenced by the commendation in the biblical Book of Proverbs , which mentions the ant twice . The first proverb admonishes , `` Go to the ant , you sluggard ! Consider her ways and be wise , which having no captain , overseer or ruler , provides her supplies in the summer , and gathers her food in the harvest '' ( 6.6 - 9 ) . Later , in a parallel saying of Agur , the insects figure among the ' four things that are little upon the earth but they are exceeding wise .

He famously stated, \"I think, therefore I am\" (Cogito, ergo sum), which is often referred to as the \"Cogito\" or \"I think.\"\n\n2. **John Locke**: Locke (1632-1704) also argued that the mind and body are separate entities. In his work \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1689), Locke posited that the mind is a non-physical substance that interacts with the body but is not reducible to it.\n\n3. **David Hume**: Hume (1711-1776) further developed the idea that the mind and body are separate entities. In his work \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\" (1748), Hume argued that the mind is a non-physical substance that interacts with the body but is not reducible to it.\n\nThese philosophers
