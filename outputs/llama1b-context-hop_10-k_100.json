It is considered one of the most important texts in Jewish tradition and serves as a bridge between the Torah and the later rabbinic literature.\n\n3. **The Shema**: A central prayer in Judaism, which is recited three times a day, affirming the unity and sovereignty of God.\n\n4. **The Kaddish**: A mournful prayer recited by Jews during funeral services, commemorating the deceased.\n\n5. **The Sefer Torah**: The oldest and most sacred text in Judaism, containing the five books of Genesis, which are considered the foundation of Jewish scripture.\n\n6. **The Zohar**: A foundational text of Jewish mysticism, written in Hebrew by Rabbi Moses de Leon in the 13th century, which explores the mystical aspects of the Torah and the nature of God.\n\n7. **The Mishnah**: A collection of Jewish oral traditions and discussions compiled in the 2nd century CE, which serves as a precursor to the Talmud.\n\n8. **The Targum**: A translation of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic, which was used in Jewish communities before the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible).\n\n9. **The Midrash**: A collection of interpretations and commentaries on the Torah, compiled in the Middle Ages, which explores the deeper meaning and significance of the text.\n\n10. **The Haggadah**: A Jewish text that accompanies the Passover Seder, which serves as a guide for the ritual and includes stories and teachings related to the holiday.\n\nHowever, if I had to choose one text that is often considered the most important Jewish text, it would be the **Torah**, as it is the foundation of Jewish

However, it's essential to note that the phrase itself has been in use for several decades.\n\nOne possible origin story dates back to the 1970s, when the Coca-Cola Company started using the phrase \"I owe you one\" or \"I owe you a Coke\" in their advertisements. This phrase was meant to convey the idea that customers were owed a free drink, often as a gesture of appreciation for their loyalty or good service.\n\nAnother possible origin story comes from a 1985 advertisement for the Coca-Cola Company, which featured a character named \"Pinky\" who would say \"I owe you a Coke\" to customers who tipped him well. This character was created by the advertising agency BBDO and was meant to be a humorous, lighthearted way to acknowledge customer loyalty.\n\nIn terms of a specific \"I owe you a Coke\" phrase, it's difficult to pinpoint an exact origin. However, a similar phrase was used by the coffee chain Starbucks in the 1990s, which said \"You owe me a cup of coffee\" to customers who tipped well.\n\nIt's worth noting that the phrase \"I owe you a Coke\" has become a common idiomatic expression, often used to express gratitude or appreciation for someone's kindness or generosity.", "gold": "Jinx is a children 's game with varying rules and penalties that occur when two people unintentionally speak the same word or phrase simultaneously", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.434014495476004e-232, "rouge-1": 0.06545454545454546, "rouge-L": 0.058181818181818175, "semantic-similarity": 0.18367525935173035}},{"question": "where does the last name hickey come from", "context": "", "answer": "The surname Hickey is of Irish origin.

They were also known for their involvement in the Irish rebellion of 1641, led by the Earl of Ormonde.\n\nIn the United States, the surname Hickey was brought by Irish immigrants in the 19th century. Today, the surname is found primarily in the United States, particularly in states such as California, Texas, and New York.\n\nIt's worth noting that the spelling of the surname has varied over time, and it is possible that different forms of the name, such as Hickey, Hickie, or Hickey, may have been used in different regions or cultures.", "gold": "Irish origin", "metrics": {"bleu": 0, "rouge-1": 0.02259887005649718, "rouge-L": 0.02259887005649718, "semantic-similarity": 0.5569861531257629}},{"question": "where do lie bumps come from on your tongue", "context": "", "answer": "Lie bumps, also known as lingual freckles or lingual freckles, are small, harmless bumps on the surface of the tongue. They are caused by the contraction and relaxation of the muscles in the tongue, particularly the lingual muscles.\n\nThese bumps are usually found on the sides of the tongue, near the back and the tip, but can also appear on the front of the tongue. They are most commonly seen in people with a high concentration of lingual muscles, which are the muscles that help to move food and liquids from the back of the throat to the mouth.\n\nLie bumps are thought to be caused by the contraction of the lingual muscles, which can lead to the formation of small, raised bumps on the tongue. This is usually a harmless and temporary phenomenon, and it can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n* Genetics: Some people may be more prone to developing lie bumps due to their genetic makeup.\n* Age: Lie bumps can appear at any age, but they are most common in people in their 20s and 30s.\n* Diet: A diet that is high in sugar and acidic foods can contribute to the development of lie bumps.\n* Stress: Stress can cause the muscles in the tongue to become tense, leading to the formation of lie bumps.\n\nIt's worth noting that lie bumps are not a sign of poor oral health or a bacterial infection. They are simply a harmless and temporary skin condition that can be caused by a variety of factors.", "gold": "<P> The name `` lie bumps '' is a result of a myth that telling lies would cause them .

types of clouds, depending on the temperature and humidity conditions. Here's a general overview of where clouds can form when a cold front approaches:\n\n1. **Cumulonimbus clouds**: These towering, vertical clouds can form when warm air from the cold front collides with cooler air from higher altitudes. As the warm air rises, it cools, and the water vapor in the air condenses, forming clouds.\n2. **Nimbostratus clouds**: These dark, featureless clouds can form when the cold front brings moist air from the front, which then cools and condenses, producing a uniform layer of cloud cover.\n3. **Cumulus clouds**: These puffy, white clouds can form when the air is warm and humid near the ground, but cooler air from the cold front brings the water vapor into contact with cooler air, causing it to condense and form clouds.\n4. **Stratocumulus clouds**: These layered, rolled clouds can form when the cold front brings moist air from the front, which then cools and condenses, producing a layered or rolled appearance.\n\nIn general, when a cold front approaches, the following conditions are often met:\n\n* Warm air from the cold front moves into the area\n* Moist air from the cold front is brought into contact with cooler air\n* The air cools, and the water vapor condenses, forming clouds\n\nThese conditions can lead to the formation of a variety of clouds, including:\n\n* Cumulus clouds\n* Cumulonimbus clouds\n* Nimbostratus clouds\n* Stratocumulus clouds\n* Altocumulus clouds\n\nKeep in mind that the specific type and intensity of clouds can vary depending on the strength and duration of the cold front, as well as other weather factors.", "gold": "<Table> <Tr> <Th> Weather phenomenon </Th> <Th> Prior to the passing of the front </Th> <Th> While the front is passing </Th> <Th> After the passing of the front </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Temperature </Td> <Td> Warm </Td> <Td> Cooling suddenly </Td> <Td> Steadily cooling </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Atmospheric pressure </Td> <Td> Decreasing steadily </Td> <Td> Lowest , then sudden increase </Td> <Td> Increasing steadily </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Winds </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Southwest to southeast ( northern hemisphere ) </Li> <Li> Northwest to northeast ( southern hemisphere ) </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> Gusty ; shifting </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> North to west , usually northwest ( northern hemisphere ) </Li> <Li> South to west , usually southwest ( southern hemisphere ) </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Precipitation / conditions * </Td> <Td> Light patchy rain can be produced by stratocumulus or stratus in the warm sector .

However, there are several historical and constitutional provisions that suggest the president's birthplace is a significant factor in their eligibility.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **The 14th Amendment**: The 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, states that \"no person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may, by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\"\n2. **The Constitution's definition of citizenship**: Article I, Section 3, Clause 4 of the Constitution defines citizenship as \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"\n3. **The Founding Fathers' intentions**: Many historians believe that the Founding Fathers, including George Washington and James Madison, intended for the president to be born in the United States. This was a common practice in British monarchies, where monarchs were often born in England.\n4. **The 25th Amendment**: In 1967, the 25th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified, which states that if a President or Vice President is unable to discharge the duties of their office, a temporary replacement can be appointed by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.\n\nWhile these provisions do not explicitly require the president to be born in the United States, they suggest that the president's birthplace is an important factor in their eligibility. In practice, the president's birthplace has been used as a factor in determining their eligibility, particularly in cases where the president is under investigation or has been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nIn recent years, there have been instances where the president's birthplace has been used as a factor in determining their eligibility, such as:\n\n* In 2017, the House of Representatives voted to impeach President Donald Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, which led to a constitutional amendment being proposed to remove the president's birthplace from the list of factors that could disqualify a president.\n* In 2021, the Senate voted to ratify the 25th Amendment, which would allow a temporary replacement to be appointed by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress if the president is unable to discharge their duties.\n\nIn summary, while the Constitution does not explicitly state that the president must be born in the United States, the 14th Amendment, the Constitution's definition of citizenship, and the Founding Fathers' intentions suggest that the president's birthplace is an important factor in determining their eligibility.", "gold": "<P> Status as a natural - born citizen of the United States is one of the eligibility requirements established in the United States Constitution for holding the office of President or Vice President .

Revere's ride was a signal for the colonists to prepare for battle.\n\n2. **John Hancock**: As the president of the Continental Congress, Hancock was a leader in the American Revolution.

According to legend, Hancock warned the colonists that the British were coming by riding to Concord and warning Samuel Adams and John Hancock.\n\n3. **Samuel Adams**: As the president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, Adams was a key figure in the American Revolution. He was also known for his leadership skills and his role in organizing the colonial militia. Adams warned the colonists that the British were coming by riding to Concord and meeting with Paul Revere.\n\nIt's worth noting that while these individuals are often credited with sounding the alarm, the exact events and individuals involved may have been more complex and nuanced.

They might have used the word \"sevens\" to refer to the 60-second unit, and \"sixes\" for the 60-minute unit.\n2. **Medieval and medieval-like numbers**: Another theory suggests that the phrase came from the medieval system of numerals, where \"six\" was used to represent 6 and \"sevens\" was used to represent 7. This system was used in the Middle Ages, and the phrase might have been a way to refer to this system.\n3. **Old English and Old Norse**: Some linguists believe that the phrase \"sixes and sevens\" comes from Old English and Old Norse, where the word \"six\" was used to refer to the 6th of the 12 months, and \"sevens\" was used to refer to the 7th of the 12 months.\n\nIt's worth noting that the phrase \"sixes and sevens\" is not a commonly used idiom in modern English, and its meaning is likely to be more abstract or metaphorical, rather than literal.", "gold": "<P> An ancient dispute between the Merchant Taylors and Skinners livery companies is the probable origin of the phrase .

The central contention of the book can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Main Argument:**\n\n1. **Wealth is a source of happiness and fulfillment**: Carnegie argues that having wealth can bring a sense of purpose, security, and happiness, which are essential human needs.\n2. **Wealth is a tool for social mobility**: Carnegie believes that wealth can be a key factor in achieving social mobility and improving one's circumstances, allowing individuals to rise above their humble beginnings.\n3. **Wealth is a means of contributing to society**: Carnegie emphasizes that wealth can be used to benefit society as a whole, through philanthropy, investments, and other forms of giving back.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n\n1. **The importance of individual effort**: Carnegie stresses that success is largely the result of individual effort, and that wealth is not solely the result of luck or privilege.\n2. **The role of social and economic conditions**: Carnegie argues that social and economic conditions, such as education and access to resources, play a significant role in determining an individual's wealth and opportunities.\n3. **The need for responsible wealth management**: Carnegie emphasizes the importance of responsible wealth management, including investing wisely and avoiding excessive risk-taking.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n\n1. **The American Dream**: Carnegie explores the idea of the American Dream, which he believes is based on the notion that anyone can achieve success and prosperity through hard work and determination.\n2. **The power of entrepreneurship**: Carnegie highlights the importance of entrepreneurship and innovation in driving economic growth and creating wealth.\n3. **The role of philanthropy**: Carnegie emphasizes the importance of philanthropy and giving back to society, arguing that it can be a powerful way to make a positive impact on the world.\n\nOverall, \"The Gospel of Wealth\" presents a nuanced and complex argument for the importance of wealth and its role in society, and offers a vision for a more equitable and prosperous world.", "gold": "<P> `` Wealth '' , more commonly known as `` The Gospel of Wealth '' , is an article written by Andrew Carnegie in June of 1889 that describes the responsibility of philanthropy by the new upper class of self - made rich . Carnegie proposed to his wife using the best way of dealing with the new phenomenon of wealth inequality was for the wealthy to redistribute their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner . This approach was contrasted with traditional bequest ( patrimony ) , where wealth is handed down to heirs , and other forms of bequest e.g. where wealth is willed to the state for public purposes . Carnegie argued that poor people put to best use ( i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society ) when it is administered carefully by the poor . Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance , irresponsible spending , or self - indulgence , instead promoting the administration of said capital over the course of one 's lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor . As a result , the wealthy should administer their riches responsibly and not in a way that encourages `` the slothful , the drunken , the unworthy '' . </P>", "metrics": {"bleu": 6.232719878487911e-232, "rouge-1": 0.3445692883895132, "rouge-L": 0.18726591760299627, "semantic-similarity": 0.8093640208244324}},{"question": "when did now thats what i call music come out", "context": "", "answer": "\"Now That's What I Call Music\" is a series of compilation albums that have been released annually in the United States since 1983.

heart) and the beginning of the ventricular depolarization (contraction of the ventricles). It is the initial phase of the cardiac cycle, often referred to as the \"isoelectric\" phase.\n\nDuring the p-wave phase, the atria contract, causing a slight increase in the electrical potential across the atrioventricular (AV) node. This increase in electrical potential triggers the rapid firing of the AV node, which then conducts the electrical impulse to the ventricles, causing them to contract.\n\nThe p-wave is characterized by:\n\n1. A slight increase in the electrical potential across the atria.\n2. A brief period of depolarization of the atria.\n3. The rapid firing of the AV node, which then conducts the electrical impulse to the ventricles.\n4. A brief period of depolarization of the ventricles.\n\nThe p-wave is often followed by the QRS complex, which represents the depolarization of the ventricles.", "gold": "atrial depolarization",

It was actually the first 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was passed in 1868, that was a direct result of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery.\n\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1866 was a federal law passed by the U.S. Congress, which was enacted during the Reconstruction era after the Civil War. This law prohibited the states from denying anyone \"the equal protection of the laws\" under the Constitution, and it also required the states to provide equal protection under the law to all citizens, regardless of race.\n\nAlthough the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was a significant step forward in promoting equality and justice, it did not amend the U.S. Constitution. It was a piece of legislation that was enacted to address the specific needs of the post-Civil War era and to promote the principles of equality and justice that were enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nThe 14th Amendment, which was passed in 1868, was a direct result of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery. It was designed to ensure that all citizens, regardless of race, were equal under the law and that the federal government had the power to enforce this principle. The 14th Amendment has been amended several times since its passage, including in 1868, 1870, 1875, 1890, 1913, 1920, 1939, 1964, and 1979.", "gold": "<P> Senator Lyman Trumbull was the Senate sponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , and he argued that Congress had power to enact it in order to eliminate a discriminatory `` badge of servitude '' prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment .

In the 20th century , the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately adopted Trumbull 's Thirteenth Amendment rationale for congressional power to ban racial discrimination by states and by private parties , in

discovery of yeast's role in bread rising is attributed to several scientists and researchers over time. Here are some key milestones:\n\n1. **Ancient Greece and Rome**: The Greek physician Hippocrates (460-370 BCE) and the Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) described the process of fermentation and its effects on food. They noted that yeast was responsible for the fermentation process that made bread rise.\n\n2. **17th century**: The Italian scientist Santorio Santorio (1561-1636) studied the fermentation process and discovered that yeast was the primary cause of bread rising. He published his findings in his book \"De Subtilitate Medicamentorum\" (On the Subtlety of Medicines).\n\n3. **1680s**: The English scientist Robert Boyle (1627-1691) conducted experiments with yeast and discovered that it produced carbon dioxide gas, which caused the dough to rise.\n\n4. **1767**: The French scientist Pierre Jean Robert (1733-1808) published a book titled \"A Treatise on Fermentation\" in which he described the process of fermentation and its effects on bread.\n\n5. **1807**: The English scientist Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) discovered that yeast was responsible for the fermentation process. He isolated yeast from beer and demonstrated its ability to ferment sugars.\n\n6. **1837**: The French scientist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) conducted extensive research on fermentation and its effects on bread. He discovered that yeast was responsible for the fermentation process and developed methods to control and harness it.\n\n7. **1857**: The American scientist Justus von Liebig (1803-1873) discovered that yeast was responsible for the fermentation process and published his findings in a paper titled \"On the Active Principles of Fermentation\" (Journal of the American Chemical Society).\n\n8. **1908**: The American scientist Albert Neufeld (1877-1949) discovered that yeast was responsible for the fermentation process and developed methods to control and harness it.\n\n9. **1912**: The American scientist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) developed the first commercial yeast culture, which was used to leaven bread.\n\n10. **1950s**: The discovery of the genetic basis of yeast fermentation led to the development of genetic engineering techniques, which allowed for the manipulation of yeast for industrial purposes.\n\nThese scientists and researchers, along with others, have contributed to our understanding of yeast's role in bread rising and its importance in food production.", "gold": "<P> The most common source of leavening in antiquity was to retain a piece of dough ( with sugar and water in ) from the previous day to utilize as a form of sourdough starter . Pliny the Elder reported that the Gauls and Iberians used the foam skimmed from beer to produce `` a lighter kind of bread than other peoples . '' Parts of the ancient world that drank wine instead of beer used a paste composed of grape must and flour that was allowed to begin fermenting , or wheat bran steeped in wine , as a source for yeast . </P>", "metrics": {"bleu": 5.83242397419506e-232, "rouge-1": 0.20425531914893616, "rouge-L": 0.12340425531914892, "semantic-similarity": 0.49296388030052185}},{"question": "who won season 4 of america's got talent", "context": " America's Got Talent, season 10 instance of television series season\n America's Got Talent, season 12 part of the series America's Got Talent\n America's Got Talent: All-Stars instance of television series\n America's Got Talent IMDb ID tt0759364\n America's Got Talent, season 16 instance of talent show\n America's Got Talent has part(s) America's Got Talent, season 17\n America's Got Talent, season 3 instance of television series season\n America's Got Talent, season 7 instance of television series season\n America's Got Talent has part(s) America's Got Talent, season 7\n America's Got Talent, season 18 part of the series America's Got Talent\n America's Got Talent: The Champions, season 2 winner V.

Austin, a famous American empresario (land agent) and empresario who played a key role in the colonization of Texas. Austin is widely regarded as the \"Father of Texas\" due to his significant contributions to the settlement and development of the state.\n\nStephen F. Austin was born in 1793 in Virginia and arrived in Texas in 1821. He was appointed as the first president of the Texas Republic and served from 1821 to 1825. During his tenure, Austin worked tirelessly to promote the colonization of Texas, establish trade relationships with Native American tribes, and encourage European settlement.\n\nAustin's efforts led to the establishment of several towns, including Austin, which was named after him, and the founding of the Republic of Texas. He also played a key role in negotiating the Texas-Canada boundary and securing the annexation of Texas by the United States.\n\nAustin's legacy extends beyond his role in the founding of Texas. He is remembered as a visionary leader who helped to shape the state's early development and played a significant role in the country's westward expansion.\n\nOther notable figures who are often referred to as the \"Father of Texas\" include:\n\n* William Barret Travis: A lawyer and empresario who was a key figure in the Battle of the Alamo and the Texas Revolution.\n* James Bowie: A legendary figure in Texas history, Bowie was a frontiersman, soldier, and empresario who played a key role in the Texas Revolution.\n* Sam Houston: A prominent empresario and politician, Houston was a key figure in the Texas Revolution and later became the president of the Republic of Texas.\n\nHowever, Stephen F.

(or \"The Tale of the Ant and the Grasshopper\" in some versions). The story is as follows:\n\nOne summer, an ant and a grasshopper prepare for the winter together. The ant works hard all summer to store food, building a nest and collecting crumbs and seeds. The grasshopper, on the other hand, spends his time singing and playing, believing that he will have plenty of food to eat during the winter.\n\nWhen winter arrives, the ant is prepared and has a sufficient amount of food stored. The ant is warm and cozy, while the grasshopper is cold and hungry. The ant asks the grasshopper for help, but the grasshopper refuses, saying that he will survive on the leftovers that the ant has stored.\n\nThe moral of the story is often interpreted in different ways, but some common interpretations include:\n\n1. **Hard work and preparation are essential for success**: The ant's hard work and preparation for the winter demonstrate the importance of planning and responsibility.\n2. **It's essential to be prepared for the future**: The ant's actions show that it's better to be prepared and work hard than to rely on luck or chance.\n3. **Don't be too comfortable and complacent**: The grasshopper's laziness and refusal to help the ant lead to his downfall.\n4. **Responsibility and gratitude are important**: The ant's gratitude for the grasshopper's help and its willingness to share its resources demonstrate the importance of gratitude and responsibility.\n\nThe moral of the story has been interpreted and applied in various contexts, including:\n\n* **Personal responsibility**: The story encourages individuals to take responsibility for their actions and to be prepared for the future.\n* **Financial responsibility**: The story can be seen as a warning against being too comfortable and not working hard to achieve financial stability.\n* **Gratitude and appreciation**: The story promotes the importance of being grateful for the help and support of others.\n\nOverall, the moral of the ant and the grasshopper is a timeless and universal message that encourages individuals to be responsible, prepared, and grateful for the opportunities and support they receive.", "gold": "<P> The story has been used to teach the virtues of hard work and the perils of improvidence .

In La Fontaine 's Fables no final judgment is made , although it has been argued that the author is there making sly fun of his own notoriously improvident ways . But the point of view in most retellings of the fable is supportive of the ant . It is also influenced by the commendation in the biblical Book of Proverbs , which mentions the ant twice . The first proverb admonishes , `` Go to the ant , you sluggard ! Consider her ways and be wise , which having no captain , overseer or ruler , provides her supplies in the summer , and gathers her food in the harvest '' ( 6.6 - 9 ) .

However, the most influential thinkers who contributed to this concept are:\n\n1. **Ren\u00e9 Descartes** (1596-1650): He is often considered the father of modern philosophy. In his work \"Meditations on First Philosophy\" (1641), Descartes stated, \"I think, therefore I am\" (Cogito, ergo sum), which posits that the only thing we can be certain of is our own existence.\n\n2. **John Locke** (1632-1704): Locke's philosophical works, particularly \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" (1689), emphasized the role of the mind in shaping our experiences and perceptions. He argued that our understanding of the world is based on our mental faculties, rather than external objects.\n\n3. **David Hume** (1711-1776): Hume's philosophical ideas, as expressed in \"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\" (1748), also focused on the mind-body problem. He argued that our understanding of the world is shaped by our mental faculties and that we can never know the external world with absolute certainty.\n\n4. **Immanuel Kant** (1724-1804): Kant's philosophical works, particularly \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (1781), explored the relationship between the mind and the external world. He argued that our understanding of the world is shaped by our cognitive faculties and that we can never have direct knowledge of the external world.\n\n5. **Jean-Paul Sartre** (1905-1980): Sartre's existentialist philosophy, as expressed in \"Being and Nothingness\" (1943), emphasized the individual's freedom and responsibility in shaping their own existence. He argued that our existence is a product of our choices and actions, and that we are ultimately responsible for our own being.\n\nThese thinkers, among others, have contributed to the ongoing debate
