In the ad, a character named Sonny the Cuckoo Bird appears on a TV show, exclaiming, \"I owe you a Coke!\" \n\nHowever, there's another theory that the phrase might be connected to the 1960s-1970s, when Coca-Cola began to sell its products in vending machines, particularly in public places like bus stations, airports, and shopping malls. In these vending machines, customers would often receive a free Coca-Cola as a thank you for their purchase.\n\nAnother possible origin of the phrase is from the 1970s-1980s, when Coca-Cola became a staple in many American households. In this context, \"I owe you a Coke\" might be seen as a way to express gratitude for a gift or a favor from someone, similar to saying \"I owe you a favor.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that the phrase gained widespread popularity in the 1990s-2000s, particularly with the rise of the \"I owe you a Coke\" meme and the phrase becoming a catchphrase in popular culture.\n\nIn summary, while the exact origin of the phrase \"I owe you a Coke\" is unclear, it's likely a combination of these factors that led to its widespread use.", "gold": "Jinx is a children 's game with varying rules and penalties that occur when two people unintentionally speak the same word or phrase simultaneously", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.590874316724141e-232, "rouge-1": 0.08196721311475409, "rouge-L": 0.06557377049180327, "semantic-similarity": 0.15575818717479706}},{"question": "where does the last name hickey come from", "context": "", "answer": "The surname Hickey is of Irish origin.

The Hickey family was known for their strong connections to the Gaelic chieftains and their involvement in the Irish wars of independence.\n\nThe name Hickey gained popularity in the United States, particularly in the mid-19th century, when many Irish immigrants arrived in the country.

They are more common in people with:\n\n- A history of frenulum removal surgery\n- A history of frenulum shortening or splitting\n- A small tongue size\n- A tongue that is not fully developed or is underdeveloped\n\nIt's worth noting that lie bumps can be a sign of a more serious condition called frenulum plicatus or frenulum profundus, which can cause problems with speech, eating, and breathing.

He is often referred to as the \"Voice of the People\" due to his strong advocacy for British interests and his criticism of the British government.\n\nIn 1780, John Bull wrote an article in The Edinburgh Gazette, which was a prominent English newspaper at the time, warning that the British army was marching towards the American colonies. He stated:\n\n\"The British army, which has been stationed in North America for the last five years, is now preparing to march on the American colonies. The time is at hand for the British to take their revenge for the wrongs they have suffered at the hands of the Americans.\"\n\nBull's article was seen as a bold warning of the impending attack, and it helped to galvanize public opinion in the United States against the British. The British government responded to the article by increasing the number of troops in North America, which ultimately led to the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War.\n\nIt's worth noting that Bull's warnings were not universally accepted, and some Americans saw his article as a threat to their rights and freedoms.

He argues that those who accumulate wealth have a moral obligation to use it to benefit society, rather than to accumulate more wealth for personal gain.\n4. **The pursuit of wealth is a spiritual journey**: Carnegie sees the pursuit of wealth as a spiritual journey, rather than just a financial one. He argues that the accumulation of wealth requires a sense of purpose, values, and character.\n\nOverall, Carnegie's \"The Gospel of Wealth\" is a call to action, urging individuals to reexamine their values and priorities in relation to wealth, and to use their wealth to make a positive impact on society.", "gold": "<P> `` Wealth '' , more commonly known as `` The Gospel of Wealth '' , is an article written by Andrew Carnegie in June of 1889 that describes the responsibility of philanthropy by the new upper class of self - made rich .

Carnegie argued that poor people put to best use ( i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society ) when it is administered carefully by the poor . Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance , irresponsible spending , or self - indulgence , instead promoting the administration of said capital over the course of one 's lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor .

This was a significant breakthrough, as it marked the beginning of a deeper understanding of the biochemical processes involved in bread rising.\n\nThe French scientist Fran\u00e7ois Pierre de La Varenne, who was a student of the famous French chef Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne, also made significant contributions to the understanding of yeast's role in bread rising. In his book \"Le Vrai Cuisinier Fran\u00e7ois\" (The True French Cook), published in 1651, La Varenne described the process of fermentation and its importance in bread making.\n\nThe modern understanding of yeast's role in bread rising, however, is often attributed to the French scientist Louis Pasteur, who conducted extensive research on the subject in the 19th century.

In La Fontaine 's Fables no final judgment is made , although it has been argued that the author is there making sly fun of his own notoriously improvident ways . But the point of view in most retellings of the fable is supportive of the ant . It is also influenced by the commendation in the biblical Book of Proverbs , which mentions the ant twice . The first proverb admonishes , `` Go to the ant , you sluggard ! Consider her ways and be wise , which having no captain , overseer or ruler , provides her supplies in the summer , and gathers her food in the harvest '' ( 6.6 - 9 ) .

He proposed the concept of the \"Form\" or \"Ideas,\" which are eternal, abstract, and perfect representations of the world.\n\n2. **Aristotle (384-322 BCE)**: Aristotle also believed in the separation of mind and body, but he also thought that the mind is a part of the body. He argued that the mind and body are interconnected, but distinct.\n\n3. **Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650)**: Descartes is famous for his statement \"I think, therefore I am\" (Cogito, ergo sum). This statement suggests that the mind is the primary entity, and the body is merely a physical shell.\n\n4. **Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)**: Kant argued that the mind and body are interconnected, but he also believed that the mind is not entirely separate from the body. He proposed the concept of \"synthetic a priori knowledge,\" which holds that some knowledge is both subjective (mind-based) and objective (body-based).\n\n5. **Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980)**: Sartre, a French philosopher, believed that human beings are \"condemned to be free,\" meaning that we have the freedom to choose our actions, but also the freedom to choose our fate. He argued that our choices and actions are the result of our own minds and bodies.\n\nThese philosophers laid the groundwork for the concept of the mind-body dualism, which is still a topic of debate and discussion in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience.", "gold": "Ren\u00e9 Descartes", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.20305087831312e-232, "rouge-1": 0.014598540145985401, "rouge-L": 0.014598540145985401, "semantic-similarity": 0.23162001371383667}},{"question": "how many goals scored ronaldo in his career", "context": " Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) given name Ronaldo\n Ronaldinho total goals in career +0\n Cristiano Ronaldo total goals in career +2\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) different from Ronaldo\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) FIFA player ID (archived) 92699\n Ronaldinho total goals in career +3\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) total goals in career +0\n Ronaldo different from Ronaldo\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) National-Football-Teams.com player ID 990\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) UEFA player ID 25879\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) member of sports team Brazil national under-17 football team\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online ID biography/Ronaldo\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) award received UEFA Club Footballer of the Year\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) total goals in career +1\n Cristiano Ronaldo total goals in career +7", "answer": "Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) total goals in career +0.", "gold": "over 670", "metrics": {"bleu": 0, "rouge-1": 0.0, "rouge-L": 0.0, "semantic-similarity": 0.13807033002376556}},{"question": "how long has house of payne been on tv", "context": " Tyler Perry's House of Payne has part(s) Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 4\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 10 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 1 instance of television series season\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 6 has part(s) Recurring Paynes\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 4 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 11 instance of television series season\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 10 instance of television series season\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 4 instance of television series season\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 3 instance of television series season\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 6 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne instance of television series\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne list of episodes list of Tyler Perry's House of Payne episodes\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 8 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne genre comedy television series\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 2 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne genre American television sitcom\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 6 has part(s) When the Payne's Away\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 1 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 6 instance of television series season\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 3 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne", "answer": "Tyler Perry's House of Payne premiered on January 10, 2006, and the show has been on the air for 17 seasons, with the final episode airing on April 20, 2022.\n\nHere's a brief breakdown of the show's run:\n\n1.
