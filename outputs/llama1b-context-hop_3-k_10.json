However, this is not definitively proven.\n\n2. **Movie and TV influence**: Another theory suggests that the phrase gained popularity after the release of the 1968 film \"Hanky Panky,\" starring Shirley MacLaine and Walter Matthau.

He believed that the mind is a separate entity from the body and that the mind's existence is independent of the physical body.\n\nDescartes' ideas about the mind-body relationship were further developed by other philosophers, including:\n\n1. John Locke (1632-1704): He argued that the mind is a tabula rasa, or a blank slate, at birth, and that experiences shape the mind through the process of association and memory.\n2. David Hume (1711-1776): He emphasized the role of chance and probability in shaping our understanding of the world, and argued that our perceptions of the world are not based on direct experience, but rather on our mental constructs.\n3. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804): He developed the concept of the \"transcendental idealism,\" which posits that the mind plays an active role in shaping our experience of reality.\n\nThese philosophers, along with others, have contributed to our understanding of the mind-body relationship and the nature of human existence.", "gold": "Ren\u00e9 Descartes", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.3922332549149414e-232, "rouge-1": 0.01568627450980392, "rouge-L": 0.01568627450980392, "semantic-similarity": 0.4692838788032532}},{"question": "how many goals scored ronaldo in his career", "context": " Ronaldo different from Ronaldo\n Cristiano Ronaldo total goals in career +7\n Cristiano Ronaldo total goals in career +2\n Ronaldinho total goals in career +3\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) total goals in career +1\n Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer) total goals in career +0", "answer": "As of my cut-off knowledge date (December 2023), Cristiano Ronaldo has scored a total of 755 goals in his career.", "gold": "over 670", "metrics": {"bleu": 0, "rouge-1": 0.0, "rouge-L": 0.0, "semantic-similarity": 0.20395374298095703}},{"question": "how long has house of payne been on tv", "context": " Tyler Perry's House of Payne genre American television sitcom\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 6 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 4 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne, season 1 part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n It's a Payne Growing Up part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n No More Payne part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Payne, Payne Go Away part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Recurring Paynes part of the series Tyler Perry's House of Payne\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne instance of television series\n Tyler Perry's House of Payne genre comedy television series", "answer": "Tyler Perry's House of Payne premiered on January 6, 2006, and the show has been on the air for over 17 years.", "gold": "<P> Tyler Perry 's House of Payne is an American sitcom television series created and produced by playwright , director , and producer Tyler Perry .
