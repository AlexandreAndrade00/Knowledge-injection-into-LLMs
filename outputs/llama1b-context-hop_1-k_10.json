The Greek physician Hippocrates (460-370 BCE) is believed to be the first to describe a fermentation process that involved yeast, but it was not specifically linked to bread rising.\n\nHowever, the Greek physician Dioscorides (40-90 CE) described a process of fermentation that involved yeast in his book \"De Materia Medica.\" He noted that yeast helped to break down sugars in grains, producing carbon dioxide gas, which caused the dough to rise.\n\nThe Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder (23-79 CE) wrote about a process of fermentation that involved yeast in his book \"Naturalis Historia.\" He described how yeast helped to leaven bread, but did not provide a detailed explanation of the process.\n\nThe modern understanding of yeast's role in bread rising was developed by the Flemish scientist Jan Baptista van Helmont (1579-1644 CE). In his book \"De Subtilitate\" (1642 CE), van Helmont described a process of fermentation that involved yeast, and provided a detailed explanation of the role of carbon dioxide gas in bread rising.\n\nThe discovery of yeast's role in bread rising was further confirmed by the French scientist Jean Senebier (1540-1621 CE). In his book \"Le M\u00e9canisme de la Fermentation\" (1623 CE), Senebier described a process of fermentation that involved yeast, and provided a detailed explanation of the role of carbon dioxide gas in bread rising.\n\nThe understanding of yeast's role in bread rising was further solidified by the work of the English scientist Joseph Priestley (1733-1804 CE). In his book \"Experiments and Observations on Air\" (1773 CE), Priestley discovered that yeast produced carbon dioxide gas, which caused the dough to rise.\n\nOverall, the discovery of yeast's role in bread rising was a gradual process that involved the contributions of many scientists over several centuries.", "gold": "<P> The most common source of leavening in antiquity was to retain a piece of dough ( with sugar and water in ) from the previous day to utilize as a form of sourdough starter .

The people are living in a desolate land, devoid of the blessings and prosperity they once knew.\n\n**The Prophecy:** Ezekiel describes a vision in which God shows him a valley that was once dry and barren. The valley was once a place of fertility, but it was now dry and withered. God then shows Ezekiel that this valley was once inhabited by the bones of Israelites who had died in exile.\n\n**The Message:** God tells Ezekiel that He will breathe new life into the valley, and it will become a place of abundance and fertility. The bones will be joined together, and new life will sprout from them. This prophecy is often interpreted as a message of hope and redemption, suggesting that God will restore Israel to its former glory.\n\n**Interpretations:** There are many interpretations of the \"Valley of Dry Bones\" prophecy, including:\n\n* A literal, physical restoration of the land, with the bones being joined together to form a new, fertile landscape.\n* A metaphorical restoration of Israel, with the \"valley\" representing a spiritual or emotional desolation, and the \"bones\" representing the people's spiritual or emotional \"death\".\n* A symbolic representation of the spiritual resurrection of the Israelites, with the \"bones\" representing the spiritual \"death\" of the old Israelite system.\n\n**Historical Significance:** The \"Valley of Dry Bones\" prophecy has had a significant impact on Jewish and Christian traditions. It has been interpreted as a call to spiritual renewal and restoration, and has influenced the development of Christian eschatology and the concept of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.\n\nOverall, the \"Valley of Dry Bones\" is a powerful and enduring symbol of hope, redemption, and restoration, with many interpretations and applications across various spiritual and cultural contexts.", "gold": "<P> In his vision the prophet sees himself standing in the valley full of dry human bones .

Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Benzene is treated with a strong base**: The methyl group is removed using a strong base such as sodium amide (NaNH2) or sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The base accepts the hydrogen atom from the methyl group, forming a carbocation intermediate.\n\n2. **The carbocation intermediate is attacked by a nucleophile**: The carbocation intermediate is attacked by a nucleophile such as water (H2O), ammonia (NH3), or an alkoxide ion (RO-).\n\n3. **The alkene product is formed**: The nucleophile attacks the carbocation intermediate, forming an alkene product with the loss of a hydrogen atom. This reaction is called an E2 mechanism.\n\n4. **The product is eliminated**: The alkene product is eliminated from the reaction, and the original benzene molecule is restored.\n\nHere's the reaction equation:\n\nC6H6 + NaNH2 \u2192 C6H5CH2 + NH3\n\nThe methyl group is removed, and a new benzene ring is formed.\n\nNote: This reaction requires a strong base, and it's not a reversible reaction.", "gold": "replacement of a methyl group by a hydrogen atom", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.648152013534332e-232, "rouge-1": 0.08510638297872342, "rouge-L": 0.08510638297872342, "semantic-similarity": 0.5132323503494263}},{"question": "what does a nose ring mean in india", "context": " India Unicode character \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\n India language used Indian Sign Language\n India Nomisma ID india\n India language used Sartang\n India flag image Flag of India.svg\n India language used Tangsa\n India hashtag india\n India language used Sansi\n India hashtag India\n India flag Flag of India", "answer": "In India, a nose ring, also known as a nose stud or nose stud, has a significant cultural and symbolic meaning.

The expedition then sailed back to Spain, where Magellan was posthumously knighted and his legacy as a hero of exploration was cemented.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the first Europeans to establish permanent settlements in the Philippines were likely the Spanish, who arrived in 1565 and established the first permanent Spanish settlement in the Philippines, which is now known as Cebu.", "gold": "<P> The first recorded visit by Europeans is the arrival of Ferdinand Magellan .

After being severely injured in a fight with the Punisher, Russo's personality and appearance undergo a drastic change.\n\nInitially, Russo's appearance and demeanor are quite different from the original comic book version. His once-sleek and stylish appearance becomes more rugged and disheveled. He is also physically changed, losing some of his muscle mass and gaining a more wiry physique.\n\nIn terms of his personality, Russo's transformation is also notable. He becomes more aggressive, violent, and unstable, as if the traumatic events of his past have driven him to madness. His actions become more erratic and violent, and he becomes increasingly obsessed with the Punisher.\n\nThe MCU version of Billy Russo is portrayed as a complex and nuanced character, driven by his own personal demons and trauma. His transformation serves as a powerful commentary on the effects of trauma and the blurred lines between sanity and madness.\n\nIt's worth noting that the MCU version of Billy Russo is not directly mentioned in the comic book series \"The Punisher\" by Garth Ennis.

Here are some key milestones in its discovery and the growing awareness of its dangers:\n\n1. **1881:** The first reported case of asbestosis, a lung disease caused by asbestos exposure, was documented in the United States. This was attributed to the use of asbestos in shipbuilding.\n\n2. **1885-1890:** The British physician John Wesley Hyatt published an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association warning about the dangers of asbestos. However, his warnings were largely ignored.\n\n3. **1891:** The British government began to take notice of asbestos's potential health risks. In 1891, the British government passed the Asbestos Act, which regulated the use of asbestos in various industries.\n\n4. **1894:** The first recorded death from asbestosis was reported in the United States. This sparked increased concern about the risks of asbestos exposure.\n\n5. **1896:** The British Medical Association published a report on the health effects of asbestos, which further highlighted the dangers of asbestos exposure.\n\n6. **1902:** The first case of mesothelioma, a rare and aggressive lung cancer caused by asbestos exposure, was reported in the United States.\n\n7. **1903:** The American Medical Association (AMA) issued a resolution stating that asbestos was a \"deadly substance\" and recommending that it be avoided.\n\n8. **1905:** The British government passed the Asbestos Act (No. 2), which prohibited the use of asbestos in certain industries, such as shipbuilding and construction.\n\n9. **1913:** The American Medical Association (AMA) issued a comprehensive report on the health effects of asbestos, which further emphasized the dangers of asbestos exposure.\n\n10. **1920s-1930s:** Asbestos use continued to decline, but the dangers of asbestos exposure became increasingly recognized, leading to stricter regulations and warnings.\n\nKeep in mind that asbestos was initially seen as a valuable industrial material, and its use was not initially regulated.

Here's the story behind its name:\n\nIn the early 17th century, the English Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, which declared that the English monarch was the supreme head of the Church of England. To ensure the official translation of the Bible, King James I, who was a devout Christian, commissioned a team of scholars to translate the Bible into English.\n\nThe team, led by Matthew Parker, Bishop of Canterbury, and William Tyndale, a Welsh scholar, worked on the translation from 1604 to 1611. They translated the entire New Testament and parts of the Old Testament, but the process was slow, and the final version was not completed until 1611.\n\nIn 1611, King James I officially approved the King James Version of the Bible, which was published in 1611. The name \"King James Version\" was chosen to reflect the king's approval and to emphasize the official nature of the translation.\n\nThe King James Version was not just a translation, but a definitive version of the Bible that was considered authoritative and reliable by the English Church. The name \"King James Version\" has since become synonymous with the Bible, and it remains one of the most widely read and studied translations of the Bible today.\n\nIt's worth noting that the term \"King James Version\" was not used to describe the Bible in its original translation. Instead, it was the title of the translation that was officially approved by King James I.", "gold": "<P> It was first printed by Robert Barker , the King 's Printer , and was the third translation into English approved by the English Church authorities : The first had been the Great Bible , commissioned in the reign of King Henry VIII ( 1535 ) , and the second had been the Bishops ' Bible , commissioned in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I ( 1568 ) . In January 1604 , King James I convened the Hampton Court Conference , where a new English version was conceived in response to the problems of the earlier translations perceived by the Puritans , a faction of the Church of England . The translation is noted for its `` majesty of style '' , and has been described as one of the most important books in English culture and a driving force in the shaping of the English - speaking world . </P>", "metrics": {"bleu": 7.76511096800871e-232, "rouge-1": 0.40404040404040403, "rouge-L": 0.24747474747474743, "semantic-similarity": 0.6780445575714111}},{"question": "where was the movie it's complicated filmed", "context": "", "answer": "The movie \"It's Complicated\" (2009) was primarily filmed in various locations in California, USA.

He emphasized that sin is a serious offense against God, and that those who refuse to repent will face severe consequences.\n2. **Justifying God's justice**: Edwards also sought to justify God's justice by highlighting the inherent goodness of creation and the nature of God. He argued that God's justice is not arbitrary, but rather rooted in His inherent goodness and the inherent goodness of creation.\n3. **Explaining the nature of sin**: Edwards used the metaphor of a person being held by an angry god to illustrate the concept of sin. He explained that sin is a deliberate choice to disobey God's laws and commandments, which results in a separation from God and a resulting suffering.\n4. **Encouraging repentance**: Ultimately, Edwards' sermon aimed to encourage his congregation to repent and turn away from sin.

For example:\n\n- \"Take the job offer, it's a great opportunity.\"\n- \"Take the road less traveled, it's a more exciting path.\"\n- \"Take the risk, it might lead to great rewards.\"\n\nIn essence, \"take it\" means to commit to a decision, path, or action, and to be prepared to see its consequences.", "gold": "<P> A fork in the road is a metaphor , based on a literal expression , for a deciding moment in life or history when a major choice of options is required .

It also established the Catholic Relief Act of 1829, which granted Catholics the right to vote, hold public office, and marry.\n\nThe Catholic Church in England was allowed to re-establish its own institutions and traditions, including the establishment of new dioceses, the restoration of Catholic schools, and the re-establishment of Catholic charities.", "gold": "Dioceses ( replacing districts ) were re-established by Pope Pius IX in 1850", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.826522266402496e-232, "rouge-1": 0.05970149253731343, "rouge-L": 0.029850746268656716, "semantic-similarity": 0.3640888035297394}},{"question": "who plays wendy the waitress in how i met your mother", "context": " How I Met Your Mother cast member Linda Porter\n How I Met Your Mother cast member Jane Seymour\n How I Met Your Mother characters Wendy the Waitress\n How I Met Your Mother IMDb ID tt0460649\n How I Met Your Mother cast member Vicki Lewis\n How I Met Your Mother cast member Katie Savoy\n How I Met Your Mother cast member Nikki Griffin\n How I Met Your Mother cast member Jennifer Morrison\n How I Met Your Mother cast member Barbara Perry\n How I Met Your Mother cast member Katie Gill", "answer": "The character Wendy the Waitress in How I Met Your Mother is played by actress Cristin Milioti.", "gold": "Charlene Amoia", "metrics": {"bleu": 0, "rouge-1": 0.0, "rouge-L": 0.0, "semantic-similarity": 0.26746734976768494}},{"question": "where did the night at the museum take place", "context": "", "answer": "The movie \"Night at the Museum\" (2006) is set in Washington, D.C., and New York City.", "gold": "New York City 's American Museum of Natural History", "metrics": {"bleu": 0, "rouge-1": 0.30769230769230765, "rouge-L": 0.23076923076923078, "semantic-similarity": 0.5260932445526123}},{"question": "a capacitor that transfers an ac signal from one stage to another is called a", "context": " Capacitor subclass of one-port circuit\n Capacitor Cultureel Woordenboek ID techologie-en-techniek/condensator\n Capacitor Microsoft Academic ID 52192207\n Capacitor subclass of passive electronic component\n Capacitor ScienceDirect topic ID materials-science/capacitor\n Capacitor has characteristic capacitance\n Capacitor described by source Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary\n Capacitor topic's main category Category:Capacitors\n Capacitor subclass of electronic component\n Capacitor MetaSat ID capacitor", "answer": "A capacitor that transfers an AC signal from one stage to another is called a **Capacitor Filter**.", "gold": "<P> In analog circuits , a coupling capacitor is used to connect two circuits such that only the AC signal from the first circuit can pass through to the next while DC is blocked .

The exclusion of grand juries from hearing evidence against defendants has been upheld by the Supreme Court in several cases, including Gregg v. Georgia (1976) and Blanton v.

Though Springtown , Tennessee , has a small monument outside an old mill claiming the song was written by a local George Johnson , in 1864 , for his Maggie , the truth is that its lyrics were written as a poem by the Canadian school teacher George Washington Johnson from Hamilton , Ontario . Margaret `` Maggie '' Clark was his pupil . They fell in love and during a period of illness , George walked to the edge of the Niagara escarpment , overlooking what is now downtown Hamilton , and composed the poem . The general tone is perhaps one of melancholy and consolation over lost youth rather than mere sentimentality or a fear of aging . It was published in 1864 in a collection of his poems entitled Maple Leaves . They were married in 1864 but Maggie 's health deteriorated and she died on May 12 , 1865 . James Austin Butterfield set the poem to music and it became popular all over the world . George Washington Johnson died in 1917 .

In the case of Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Co. v.

However, the Court also established that states could not regulate interstate commerce or activities that were not within their borders.\n\nIn essence, the Court ruled that states could regulate railroad companies that operated entirely within their borders, but could not regulate those that operated across state lines or in interstate commerce.\n\nSo, while the Court did limit the scope of state regulation, it did not completely eliminate it, and states were still able to regulate railroad companies within their borders.", "gold": "<P> The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 is a United States federal law that was designed to regulate the railroad industry , particularly its monopolistic practices .

Here's a brief summary:\n\n**Plot:**\n\nThe story revolves around a young inventor, who creates a flying machine that is powered by a combination of steam and a mysterious, glowing liquid. The inventor's machine is called the \"Aerius,\" and it has the potential to revolutionize transportation.\n\nHowever, as the inventor tests the Aerius, it begins to malfunction and cause chaos. The machine starts to fly on its own, and the inventor is left to deal with the consequences.\n\nThe story explores themes of scientific hubris, the dangers of unchecked ambition, and the consequences of playing with forces beyond human control.\n\n**Symbolism:**\n\nThe Aerius represents the power of human ingenuity and the potential for scientific progress. However, the machine's malfunction also symbolizes the unpredictability and uncontrollable nature of scientific advancements.\n\n**Style:**\n\nThe story is written in a lyrical and poetic style, with vivid descriptions of the inventor's workshop and the Aerius's flight. Bradbury's use of language creates a sense of wonder and awe, while also conveying the sense of unease and foreboding.\n\n**Themes:**\n\nThe Flying Machine explores several themes, including:\n\n1. The dangers of scientific hubris\n2. The importance of responsible innovation\n3. The unpredictability of technological advancements\n4.

Thus Yuan orders that the inventor shall be executed because , while his flying machine may be a beautiful creation , the emperor sees the devastating potential for those who `` have an evil face and an evil heart '' and will seek to use it for purposes other than the enjoyment of flight , namely flying over the Great Wall of China ( which he himself created ) and destroying it . For this reason , the inventor is executed , the flying machine burned , and all who saw it are silenced .

This technique detects the velocity of blood flow, which is used to diagnose conditions like blood clots, varicose veins, or stenosis (narrowing of blood vessels). The Doppler signal is usually displayed as a waveform, with the x-axis representing time and the y-axis representing frequency.\n\n**Duplex Ultrasound:**\nDuplex ultrasound combines Doppler ultrasound with conventional ultrasound imaging. The Doppler component provides additional information about the blood flow and vascular anatomy, while the conventional ultrasound component provides a 2D image of the vascular structures. This combination allows for a more detailed understanding of the vascular system and its relationship to other tissues.\n\nKey differences:\n\n1. **Dual purpose:** Doppler ultrasound provides both Doppler information and conventional ultrasound imaging, while duplex ultrasound provides both Doppler and conventional ultrasound imaging.\n2. **Data analysis:** Doppler ultrasound analyzes the Doppler signal to provide information about blood flow, while duplex ultrasound analyzes the conventional ultrasound image to provide information about vascular anatomy and other structures.\n3. **Resolution:** Duplex ultrasound typically provides a higher resolution image than Doppler ultrasound, as it combines the benefits of both modalities.\n\nIn summary, Doppler ultrasound focuses on measuring blood flow, while duplex ultrasound provides a comprehensive imaging and diagnostic information about the vascular system.", "gold": "<P> Doppler ultrasonography is medical ultrasonography that employs the Doppler effect to generate imaging of the movement of tissues and body fluids ( usually blood ) , and their relative velocity to the probe .

Mitchell , the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation are coupled by a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane . The efflux of protons from the mitochondrial matrix creates an electrochemical gradient ( proton gradient ) . This gradient is used by the F F ATP synthase complex to make ATP via oxidative phosphorylation . ATP synthase is sometimes described as Complex V of the electron transport chain . The F component of ATP synthase acts as an ion channel that provides for a proton flux back into the mitochondrial matrix . It is composed of a , b and c subunits . Protons in the inter-membranous space of mitochondria first enters the ATP synthase complex through a subunit channel . Then protons move to the c subunits . The number of c subunits it has determines how many protons it will require to make the F turn one full revolution . For example , in humans , there are 8 c subunits , thus 8 protons are required . After c subunits , protons finally enters matrix using a subunit channel that opens into the mitochondrial matrix . This reflux releases free energy produced during the generation of the oxidized forms of the electron carriers ( NAD and Q ) . The free energy is used to drive ATP synthesis , catalyzed by the F component of the complex . Coupling with oxidative phosphorylation is a key step for ATP production . However , in specific cases , uncoupling the two processes may be biologically useful . The uncoupling protein , thermogenin -- present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipose tissue -- provides for an alternative flow of protons back to the inner mitochondrial matrix .

This spin is crucial for several reasons:\n\n1. **Stabilizes the projectile**: The spin imparted by rifling causes the bullet to maintain its orientation in flight, resulting in a more consistent and predictable trajectory.\n2. **Increases accuracy**: The spin helps to stabilize the bullet's flight path, reducing the effects of air resistance and allowing the bullet to hit its target more accurately.\n3. **Improves range**: By stabilizing the bullet's flight path, rifling enables the bullet to travel farther without significant loss of accuracy.\n4. **Enhances terminal velocity**: The spin imparted by rifling helps to increase the terminal velocity of the bullet, making it more resistant to deceleration and reducing the likelihood of penetration.\n\nThe type of rifling present in a barrel depends on the intended use of the firearm. There are several types of rifling, including:\n\n* **Polygonal rifling**: Used in most firearms, this type of rifling creates a spiral groove in the barrel.\n* **Cylindrical rifling**: Used in some rifles and shotguns, this type of rifling creates a cylindrical groove in the barrel.\n* **Normal rifling**: Used in some sniper rifles and other specialized firearms, this type of rifling creates a flat, square groove in the barrel.\n\nOverall, the presence of rifling in the bore of a barrel is a critical factor in determining the performance and accuracy of a firearm.", "gold": "for the purpose of exerting torque and thus imparting a spin to a projectile around its longitudinal axis during shooting", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.348812110130843e-232, "rouge-1": 0.08396946564885496, "rouge-L": 0.06106870229007634, "semantic-similarity": 0.5481350421905518}},{"question": "where do the amino acids come from in protein synthesis", "context": " Protein biosynthesis has part(s) protein polypeptide chain\n Protein biosynthesis National Library of Israel J9U ID 987007562989105171\n Protein biosynthesis Library of Congress authority ID sh85107655\n Protein biosynthesis Library of Congress authority ID sh85053874\n Protein biosynthesis National Library of Israel J9U ID 987007541253705171\n Protein biosynthesis said to be the same as translation\n Protein biosynthesis subclass of peptide biosynthetic process\n Protein biosynthesis has part(s) translational elongation\n Protein biosynthesis subclass of protein metabolic process\n Protein biosynthesis instance of biological process", "answer": "Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and their origin is a fascinating topic in biochemistry.

They can be obtained through various means, such as dietary intake, bacterial fermentation, or endogenously produced through metabolic pathways.\n   - **Amino Acid Metabolism**: Amino acids can be broken down and recycled through various metabolic pathways, including:\n     - **Transamination**: Amino acids are converted into keto-acids, which can then be converted into new amino acids.\n     - **Deamination**: Amino groups are removed from amino acids, resulting in the production of ammonia and a new amino acid.\n     - **Oxidative Deamination**: Amino acids are converted into alpha-keto acids, which can then be converted into new amino acids.\n   - **Amino Acid Recycling**: Some amino acids can be recycled through various mechanisms, such as:\n     - **Amino Acid Cycle**: Amino acids can be converted into ammonia, which is then converted into urea.\n     - **Succinate Dehydrogenase**: Amino acids can be converted into succinate, which can then be converted into acetyl-CoA.\n\n2. **Protein Synthesis**: In protein synthesis, amino acids are incorporated into a growing polypeptide chain through a process called translation.\n\n3. **Amino Acid Sequence**: The sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by the order in which they are incorporated into the polypeptide chain during translation.\n\nHere's a simplified example:\n\nAmino acids are obtained from the following sources:\n\n- **Food**: Amino acids are obtained from protein-rich foods such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, and nuts.\n- **Bacteria**: Amino acids are obtained through bacterial fermentation.\n- **Endogenous**: Amino acids are produced within the body through metabolic pathways.\n\nThe amino acids are then incorporated into a growing polypeptide chain through translation, resulting in a protein with a specific sequence of amino acids.", "gold": "tRNA molecules", "metrics": {"bleu": 0, "rouge-1": 0.0, "rouge-L": 0.0, "semantic-similarity": 0.20675118267536163}},{"question": "did germany have any aircraft carriers during world war ii", "context": " World War II location Europe\n World War II follows World War I\n World War II instance of world war\n World War II has effect Bombing of Dresden\n Germany member of International Civil Aviation Organization\n World War II has part(s) Operation Barbarossa\n Germany member of Missile Technology Control Regime\n World War II participant Nazi Germany\n Germany member of European Air Transport Command\n Germany history of topic history of Germany", "answer": "Yes, Germany had one aircraft carrier during World War II.

In those days, people would hang a rope over a hole or a container to collect waste. When someone \"pissed up a rope,\" they were essentially saying that they had relieved themselves by hanging the rope over the hole.\n\nAnother theory suggests that the phrase may have originated from the practice of using a rope to hang a urinal or a container to store urine. In this context, \"piss up a rope\" could have been used as a humorous way to describe the act of urinating.\n\nThe phrase gained wider usage in the 19th century, particularly in the United States. It's often used in a lighthearted or playful manner to express surprise, shock, or disappointment.\n\nIt's worth noting that the phrase has been in use for centuries, and its origins may be lost to history.

According to the Big Bang theory, the universe was initially a hot, dense plasma, with all matter and energy in a state of complete freedom.\n\nOne of the most widely accepted theories is the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) model, which suggests that helium-4 (\u00b2He) was formed through the rapid cooling and expansion of the universe. This process, known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, occurred during the first few minutes after the Big Bang.\n\nDuring this time, the universe was still extremely hot, and the temperature was around 10-20 million degrees Celsius. As the universe expanded and cooled, the electrons and protons began to combine to form neutral atoms, including helium-4. This process is known as proton-neutron capture.\n\nThe exact conditions and temperatures required for helium-4 formation are still a topic of ongoing research and debate. However, most scientists agree that helium-4 was formed through a combination of:\n\n1. Proton-proton reactions: These occur when high-energy particles collide and fuse protons to form neutrons and protons.\n2. Neutron capture: This occurs when a neutron collides with a proton, resulting in the formation of a neutron and a proton.\n3. Electron capture: This occurs when an electron collides with a proton, resulting in the formation of a neutron and an electron.\n\nThe abundance of helium-4 in the universe is consistent with the predictions of the BBN model, and it is thought to have formed about 700 million years after the Big Bang.", "gold": "Primordial nucleosynthesis", "metrics": {"bleu": 4.388531411546695e-232, "rouge-1": 0.007380073800738007, "rouge-L": 0.007380073800738007, "semantic-similarity": 0.4097602069377899}},{"question": "what is meant by cyst in the ovary", "context": "", "answer": "A cyst in the ovary is a fluid-filled sac or pouch that forms on the outer surface of the ovary.

In the 6th century BCE, the Greek physician Hippocrates emphasized the importance of patient autonomy and informed consent.\n2. **17th-century England**: The concept of informed consent was formally introduced in 17th-century England, where the physician Thomas Sydenham advocated for the right of patients to make informed decisions about their treatment.\n3. **19th-century United States**: The concept of informed consent gained traction in the United States during the 19th century, particularly in the field of medicine.

Phil is then placed in a special chamber with a hole in the front, and a camera is set up to capture his prediction. If Phil sees his shadow, it means there will be six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't see his shadow, it means spring will arrive sooner.\n\n**What does Phil say?**\n\nAccording to the tradition, Phil's prediction is based on his behavior in the chamber.

In 1869, Matthew Maguire, a machinist and secretary of the Central Labor Union in New York, suggested that workers should have a day to celebrate their labor and the benefits it brings.\n\n**The First Labor Day Celebration:** On September 5, 1882, the first Labor Day celebration was held in New York City. Maguire's idea gained popularity, and other cities began to organize their own celebrations.\n\n**The National Labor Day Convention:** In 1884, the first national Labor Day convention was held in New York City, where over 20,000 workers attended. The convention adopted a resolution calling for a national Labor Day to be celebrated on the first Monday in September.\n\n**The 1884 Labor Day Act:** In 1884, President Grover Cleveland signed a bill that made Labor Day a federal holiday. However, it wasn't until 1894 that the law was amended to make Labor Day a national holiday.\n\n**The Modern Holiday:** In 1894, President Grover Cleveland signed a law making Labor Day a national holiday to be celebrated on the first Monday in September. The law was later amended in 1898 to make it a federal holiday that would be celebrated on the first Monday in September every year.\n\n**The Name \"Labor Day\":** The term \"Labor Day\" was officially adopted in 1894, when the U.S. Congress passed a law making the holiday a federal holiday. The name \"Labor Day\" was chosen to honor the contributions and achievements of American workers.\n\nToday, Labor Day is celebrated on the first Monday in September in the United States and many other countries around the world.", "gold": "<P> Beginning in the late 19th century , as the trade union and labor movements grew , trade unionists proposed that a day be set aside to celebrate labor . `` Labor Day '' was promoted by the Central Labor Union and the Knights of Labor , which organized the first parade in New York City .

This land was granted to American settlers through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war. These grants were often based on the principles of \" Manifest Destiny,\" which held that the United States was destined to expand its territory.\n2. **Land Run Era**: In the late 19th century, the United States government held public land sales, known as land runs. These sales allowed settlers to claim up to 160 acres of land for free, provided they were willing to settle and farm it. The most famous land run was the 1889 Cheyenne Frontier Days land run in Wyoming, which attracted thousands of settlers.\n3. **State Land Sales**: Many states, such as California, Arizona, and New Mexico, also held land sales to settle their territories. These sales often provided settlers with a chance to claim land for free or at a low cost.\n4. **Homestead Act**: The Homestead Act of 1862 allowed settlers to claim up to 160 acres of land for free, provided they lived on it and farmed it for five years. This act was a significant incentive for settlers to move west and establish farms.\n5. **Private Land Sales**: Some settlers purchased land directly from private owners, often through auctions or negotiations.\n\nHere are some key statistics on land ownership in the Western United States:\n\n* By 1860, approximately 70% of the land in the United States was owned by private individuals.\n* By 1880, the Homestead Act had led to over 2 million settlers claiming land in the West.\n* By 1890, the total number of settlers in the West had exceeded 10 million.\n\nKeep in mind that these statistics vary depending on the specific region and the time period.

The introduction of sound in films, with the advent of the \"talkies\" in the late 1920s, revolutionized the medium.\n\n3. **Literature:** The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a surge in American literary movements, including the rise of the \"Lost Generation\" (e.g., Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald) and the emergence of the \"New Journalism\" (e.g., Upton Sinclair, John Dos Passos).\n\n4. **Fashion:** The early 20th century saw a shift towards more streamlined, modern styles, with the influence of European fashion. The \"flapper\" era, characterized by shorter hemlines, dropped waistlines, and beaded dresses, marked a significant departure from traditional feminine attire.\n\n5. **Art and Architecture:** The early 20th century saw a renewed interest in modernism, with architects like Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis Sullivan, and William Van Alen pushing the boundaries of design. The rise of the Art Deco style, popularized by designers like Louis Comfort Tiffany and the Art Deco movement, also characterized the era.\n\n6. **Sports:** American sports, particularly baseball, basketball, and football, gained popularity during this period. The early 20th century saw the establishment of professional leagues, including the National League (1876) and the National Football League (1920).\n\n7. **Television:** The late 1920s and early 1930s saw the emergence of radio broadcasting, which eventually gave way to television. The first commercial television broadcasts began in 1928, with the introduction of the \"Black Box\" by John Logie Baird.\n\n8. **Fashion Trends:** The early 20th century saw a rise in fashion trends, including the popularity of hats, gloves, and scarves. The \"housewife\" style, characterized by modest, practical clothing, became a staple of American fashion.\n\n9. **Social Change:** The turn of the 20th century also witnessed significant social change, including the rise of feminism, the women's suffrage movement, and the growing awareness of racial and ethnic diversity.\n\n10. **Media:** The early 20th century saw the emergence of new media, including newspapers, magazines, and newspapers. The rise of the \"yellow journalism\" style, popularized by publications like the New York World, marked a significant shift in the way news was consumed.\n\nThese changes collectively contributed to the transformation of American popular culture around the turn of the 20th century.", "gold": "developed a series of new forms of music", "metrics": {"bleu": 3.662861251835537e-232, "rouge-1": 0.030042918454935622, "rouge-L": 0.02145922746781116, "semantic-similarity": 0.42714786529541016}},{"question": "how soon after death does rigamortis set in", "context": " Rigor mortis instance of decomposition\n Rigor mortis Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online ID science/rigor-mortis\n Rigor mortis MeSH descriptor ID D012298\n Rigor mortis follows algor mortis\n Rigor mortis MeSH tree code C23.550.260.224.617.839\n Rigor mortis Store medisinske leksikon ID d\u00f8dsstivhet\n Rigor mortis described by source New Encyclopedic Dictionary\n Rigor mortis followed by livor mortis\n Rigor mortis Commons category Rigor mortis\n Rigor mortis WikiKids ID Lijkstijfheid", "answer": "Rigor mortis typically sets in 2-4 hours after death, and the process can be divided into three stages:\n\n1. **Acute rigor mortis**: This is the initial stage, where the body stiffens within 2-4 hours after death.

Here are the key reasons:\n\n1. **Historical Significance**: J&K was a princely state ruled by the Dogra dynasty until it was annexed by India in 1947. The state's strategic location and rich cultural heritage made it an attractive prize for the British East India Company.\n2. **Pre-Partition Politics**: J&K was a British protectorate, with the British monarch serving as the head of state. This system allowed the state to maintain its autonomy while being under British protection.\n3. **Constitutional Provisions**: The J&K State Reorganisation Act, 1956, and the Jammu and Kashmir (Reorganisation) Act, 1970, were passed by the Indian Parliament to reorganize the state into a union territory. These acts gave J&K a degree of autonomy, but with certain provisions that allowed the Indian Parliament to intervene in state matters.\n4. **Special Powers**: The J&K Special Powers (Andhra Pradesh) Act, 1954, grants the state special powers, such as the right to maintain law and order, to deal with situations like communal riots and militancy.\n5. **Military Presence**: The Indian Army has a significant military presence in J&K, with a large number of troops stationed in the state. This presence is seen as a deterrent against any potential separatist movements.\n6. **Economic Development**: J&K has a unique economic profile, with a mix of agriculture, industry, and services. The state has been investing in infrastructure development, including roads, bridges, and ports, to promote economic growth.\n7. **Cultural Autonomy**: The J&K Constitution, 1956, grants the state a degree of autonomy in matters of culture, language, and education. This has allowed the state to preserve its unique cultural identity.\n\nThe special status of J&K is divided into three phases:\n\n1. **Initial Phase (1950-1956)**: The state was governed by the Dogra dynasty and had a degree of autonomy.\n2. **Reorganisation Phase (1956-1970)**: The state was reorganized into a union territory, with the Indian Parliament exercising control over certain matters.\n3. **Current Phase (1970-present)**: The state has continued to evolve, with a mix of autonomous and semi-autonomous powers granted to the state by the Indian Parliament.\n\nOverall, J&K's special status is a result of its unique historical, cultural, and geographical characteristics, which have been shaped by its complex relationship with India.", "gold": "<P> Article 370 of the Indian constitution is an article that gives autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir .

Here are some of the ways they kept time:\n\n1. **Solar Time**: The most common method was to divide the day into 24 equal periods, with each period called an hour. The sun was used to divide the day into 12 equal periods, with each period called an hour.\n2. **Astronomical Observations**: People used the movements of celestial bodies, such as the sun, moon, and stars, to estimate the time. They would observe the position of these bodies in the sky and use their knowledge of astronomy to calculate the time.\n3. **Candle Clocks**: In ancient China, candle clocks were used to measure time. A candle was marked with equally spaced lines, and the time was measured by the number of lines burned.\n4. **Water Clocks**: Water clocks, also known as clepsydras, were used in ancient civilizations, including the Romans and Chinese. They measured time by the flow of water from one container to another.\n5. **Sundials**: Sundials were used to measure time by the shadow of a vertical stick or object. The shadow would move across a calibrated surface, indicating the time.\n6. **Hourglasses**: Hourglasses were used to measure time by the flow of sand from one container to another. The flow of sand was calibrated to indicate the time.\n7. **Mechanical Clocks**: Mechanical clocks, which were developed in Europe during the Middle Ages, used a combination of gears and escapements to measure time. They were powered by weights or springs and were often decorated with intricate mechanisms.\n8. **Observatory-based Timekeeping**: Many monasteries and churches had observatories where monks would track the movements of celestial bodies to calculate the time.\n\nThese methods were not always accurate, and the concept of a standardized timekeeping system did not emerge until the Renaissance. However, the Middle Ages saw significant advances in timekeeping, and the use of mechanical clocks became more widespread.", "gold": "<P> During the Middle Ages , clocks primarily served religious purposes ; the first employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century .

It was the first of its kind to be clearly recorded in Ireland , and would only have had an hour hand . The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks .

These days were considered sacred and were marked with rituals, offerings, and ceremonies to welcome the spirits back into the world of the living.\n\nThe Aztecs believed that the souls of the dead would return to Earth on the following dates:\n\n* August 1st: The Day of the Dead, which marked the beginning of the new year and the return of the spirits.\n* November 1st: The Day of the Dead, which honored the Aztec goddess of death, Mictecacihuatl.\n* December 1st: The Day of the Dead, which honored the Aztec god of the underworld, Xipe Totec.\n\nWhen the Spanish conquistadors arrived in Mexico in the 16th century, they introduced their own Catholic traditions and customs, which merged with the existing indigenous practices. The Catholic Church established November 1st as All Saints' Day, which became a day to honor all saints and martyrs. The Catholic Church also introduced the concept of the \"D\u00eda de los Inocentes\" (Day of the Innocents), which honored the children and infants who died.\n\nOver time, the traditional Aztec and Mayan practices were incorporated into the Catholic celebrations, and the Day of the Dead evolved into the unique holiday we know today.
